       "  'abstract': \"Epigenetic mechanisms occurring in the brain as well as alterations in the gut microbiome composition might contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human amyloid precursor protein knock-in (KI) mice contain the Swedish and Iberian mutations (AppNL-F) or those two and also the Arctic mutation (AppNL-G-F). In this study, we assessed whether behavioral and cognitive performance in 6-month-old AppNL-F, AppNL-G-F, and C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice was associated with the gut microbiome, and whether the genotype modulates this association. The genotype effects observed in behavioral tests were test-dependent. The biodiversity and composition of the gut microbiome linked to various aspects of mouse behavioral and cognitive performance but differences in genotype modulated these relationships. These genotype-dependent associations include members of the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families. In a subset of female mice, we assessed DNA methylation in the hippocampus and investigated whether alterations in hippocampal DNA methylation were associated with the gut microbiome. Among other differentially methylated regions, we identified a 1\\xa0Kb region\\xa0that overlapped\\xa0ing 3'UTR of the Tomm40 gene and the promoter region of the Apoe gene that\\xa0and was significantly more methylated in the hippocampus of AppNL-G-F than WT mice. The integrated gut microbiome hippocampal DNA methylation analysis revealed a positive relationship between amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) within the Lachnospiraceae family and methylation at the Apoe gene. Hence, these microbes may elicit an impact on AD-relevant behavioral and cognitive performance via epigenetic changes in AD-susceptibility genes in neural tissue or that such changes in the epigenome can elicit alterations in intestinal physiology that affect the growth of these taxa in the gut microbiome.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Thyroid hormone signaling plays an essential role in muscle development and function, in the maintenance of muscle mass, and in regeneration after injury, via activation of thyroid nuclear receptor alpha (THRA). A mouse model of resistance to thyroid hormone carrying a frame-shift mutation in the THRA gene (THRA-PV) is associated with accelerated skeletal muscle loss with aging and impaired regeneration after injury. The expression of nuclear orphan receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-factor II (COUP-TFII, or Nr2f2) persists during myogenic differentiation in THRA-PV myoblasts and skeletal muscle of aged THRA-PV mice and it is known to negatively regulate myogenesis. Here, we report that in murine myoblasts COUP-TFII interacts with THRA and modulates THRA binding to thyroid response elements (TREs). Silencing of COUP-TFII expression restores in vitro myogenic potential of THRA-PV myoblasts and shifts the mRNA expression profile closer to WT myoblasts. Moreover, COUP-TFII silencing reverses the transcriptomic profile of THRA-PV myoblasts and results in reactivation of pathways involved in muscle function and extracellular matrix remodeling/deposition. These findings indicate that the persistent COUP-TFII expression in THRA-PV mice is responsible for the abnormal muscle phenotype. In conclusion, COUP-TFII and THRA cooperate during post-natal myogenesis, and COUP-TFII is critical for the accelerated skeletal muscle loss with aging and impaired muscle regeneration after injury in THRA-PV mice.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'IPTG-inducible promoter is popularly used for the expression of recombinant proteins. However, it is not suitable at the industrial scale due to the high cost and toxicity on the producing cells. Recently, a Self-Inducible Expression (SILEX) system has developed to bypass such problems using Hsp70 as an autoinducer. Herein, the effect of other heat shock proteins on the autoinduction of green fluorescent protein (EGFP), romiplostim, and interleukin-2 was investigated. For quantitative measurements, EGFP expression was monitored after double-transformation of pET28a-EGFP and pET21a-(Hsp27/Hsp40/Hsp70) plasmids into E. coli using fluorimetry. Moreover, the expression level, bacterial growth curve, and plasmid and expression stability were compared to an IPTG- inducible system using EGFP. Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference in EGFP expression between autoinducible and IPTG-inducible systems. The expression level was higher in Hsp27 system than Hsp70/Hsp40 systems. However, the highest amount of expression was observed for the inducible system. IPTG-inducible and Hsp70 systems showed more lag-time in the bacterial growth curve than Hsp27/Hsp40 systems. A relatively stable EGFP expression was observed in SILEX systems after several freeze-thaw cycles within 90\\xa0days, while, IPTG-inducible system showed a decreasing trend compared to the newly transformed bacteria. Moreover, the inducible system showed more variation in the EGFP expression among different clones than clones obtained by SILEX systems. All designed SILEX systems successfully self-induced the expression of protein models. In conclusion, Hsp27 system could be considered as a suitable autoinducible system for protein expression due to less metabolic burden, lower variation in the expression level, suitable plasmid and expression stability, and a higher expression level.',\n",

Cysteine residues within TMF sense cellular redox to form disulfide bonds that concatenate multiple TMF molecules and elevate the amount of intrinsically disordered regions to drive phase separation. Oxidation triggered phase separation enables TMF to bind and sequester the promoter of a floral identity gene ANANTHA to repress its expression.

       "  'abstract': 'Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impaired skills in social interaction and communication in addition to restricted and repetitive behaviors. Many different factors may contribute to ASD development; in particular, oxytocin receptor (OXTR) deficiency has been reported to be associated with ASD, although the detailed mechanism has remained largely unknown. Epidemiological study has shown that maternal diabetes is associated with ASD development. In this study, we aim to investigate the potential role of OXTR on maternal diabetes-mediated social deficits in offspring. Our in vitro study of human neuron progenitor cells showed that hyperglycemia induces OXTR suppression and that this suppression remains during subsequent normoglycemia. Further investigation showed that OXTR suppression is due to hyperglycemia-induced persistent oxidative stress and epigenetic methylation in addition to the subsequent dissociation of estrogen receptor β (ERβ) from the OXTR promoter. Furthermore, our in vivo mouse study showed that maternal diabetes induces OXTR suppression; prenatal OXTR deficiency mimics and potentiates maternal diabetes-mediated anxiety-like behaviors, while there is less of an effect on autism-like behaviors. Additionally, postnatal infusion of OXTR partly, while infusion of ERβ completely, reverses maternal diabetes-induced social deficits. We conclude that OXTR may be an important factor for ASD development and that maternal diabetes-induced suppression of oxytocin receptor contributes to social deficits in offspring.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related and second most common neurodegenerative disorder. In recent years, increasing evidence revealed that peripheral immune cells might be able to infiltrate into brain tissues, which could arouse neuroinflammation and aggravate neurodegeneration. This study aimed to illuminate the landscape of peripheral immune cells and signature genes associated with immune infiltration in PD. Several transcriptomic datasets of substantia nigra (SN) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were separately collected as training cohort, testing cohort, and external validation cohort. The immunoscore of each sample calculated by single-sample gene set enrichment analysis was used to reflect the peripheral immune cell infiltration and to identify the differential immune cell types between PD and healthy participants. According to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the immunoscore achieved an overall accuracy of the area under the curve (AUC) = 0.883 in the testing cohort, respectively. The immunoscore displayed good performance in the external validation cohort with an AUC of 0.745. The correlation analysis and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the correlation between immune cells and PD, and mast cell was identified most associated with the occurrence of PD. Additionally, increased mast cells were also observed in our in vivo PD model. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to selected module genes related to a mast cell. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis and random-forest analysis were used to analyze module genes, and two hub genes RBM3 and AGTR1 were identified as associated with mast cells in the training cohort. The expression levels of RBM3 and AGTR1 in these cohorts and PD models revealed that these hub genes were significantly downregulated in PD. Moreover, the expression trend of the aforementioned two genes differed in mast cells and dopaminergic (DA) neurons. In conclusion, this study not only exhibited a landscape of immune infiltrating patterns in PD but also identified mast cells and two hub genes associated with the occurrence of PD, which provided potential therapeutic targets for PD patients (PDs).\",\n",

Nematodes exposed to E. ulmoides and C. chinensis extracts, starting at the young adult stage, exhibited prolonged lifespan and increased survival after heat stress as well as upon exposure to the pathogenic bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens, whereby the survival benefits were monitored after stress initiation at different adult stages. However, only C. chinensis had the ability to enhance physical fitness: the swimming behavior and the pharyngeal pumping rate of C. elegans were improved at day 7 and especially at day 12 of adulthood. Finally, monitoring the red fluorescence of aged worms revealed that only C. chinensis extracts caused suppression of intestinal autofluorescence, a known marker of aging. The results underline the different modes of action of the tested plants extracts. E. ulmoides improved specifically the physiological fitness by increasing the survival probability of C. elegans after stress, while C. chinensis seems to be an overall healthspan enhancer, reflected in the suppressed autofluorescence, with beneficial effects on physical as well as physiological fitness. The C. chinensis effects may be hormetic: this is supported by increased gene expression of hsp-16.1 and by trend, also of hsp-12.6.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Increasing antibiotic resistance and diminishing pharmaceutical industry investments have increased the need for molecules that can treat infections caused by dangerous pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Quorum Sensing (QS) is a signaling mechanism that regulates bacterial virulence in pathogens. A report demonstrating that the anti-inflammatory drug Diflunisal reduces MRSA virulence factors' expression prompted us to design, synthesize and test 16 aza-analogs as inhibitors of S. aureus virulence factors controlled by the accessory gene regulator (agr) QS system. At first, we evaluated by qRT-PCR the activity of compounds on rnaIII expression, a QS related gene. Azan-7 was the most active molecule tested and it did not show cytotoxic activity in human cell lines. Moreover, we demonstrated that it did not affect bacterial proliferation. Regulation of MRSA virulence genes by Azan-7 was investigated using qRT-PCR and RNAseq. Azan-7 significantly reduced hla, psmα, hysA, agrA, cap1A, and cap1C gene expression. In silico docking demonstrated that Azan-7 binds the response regulator AgrA. This data was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) reporting that Azan-7 binding to AgrA protein strongly reduced the AgrA-DNA complex formation at the P3 promoter region involved in the regulation of rnaIII transcription. Azan-7 inhibited MRSA-mediated haemolysis, reduced survival of the pathogen at low pH levels, and increased macrophage killing. In addition, Azan-7 enhanced MRSA susceptibility to clindamycin both in planktonic growth and biofilm. Azan-7 did not induce resistance over 10 days in culture. It was equally active against all the AgrA MRSA subtypes encountered among clinical isolates, but it was not active against Staphylococcus epidermidis, although the AgrA proteins show an approximate 80% homology. These results demonstrate that Azan-7 inhibits the expression of MRSA virulence factors by interfering in the QS and synergizes MRSA biofilm with clindamycin, indicating the compound as a promising candidate for the treatment of MRSA infections.\",\n",

Glycosyltransferases (GTs) work together to synthesize the saccharide components of the plant cell wall. The Arabidopsis thaliana fucosyltransferases (FUTs), AtFUT4, and AtFUT6, are members of the plant-specific GT family 37 (GT37). AtFUT4 and AtFUT6 transfer fucose (Fuc) onto arabinose (Ara) residues of arabinogalactan (AG) proteins (AGPs) and have been postulated to be non-redundant AGP-specific FUTs. AtFUT4 and AtFUT6 were recombinantly expressed in mammalian HEK293 cells and purified for biochemical analysis. We report an updated understanding on the specificities of AtFUT4 and AtFUT6 that are involved in the synthesis of wall localized AGPs. Our findings suggest that they are selective enzymes that can utilize various arabinogalactan (AG)-like and non-AG-like oligosaccharide acceptors, and only require a free, terminal arabinofuranose.

       "  'abstract': \"The development of single-cell sequencing technologies has allowed researchers to gain important new knowledge about the expression profile of genes in thousands of individual cells of a model organism or tissue. A common disadvantage of this technology is the loss of the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the cells. Consequently, the Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods (DREAM) organized the Single-Cell Transcriptomics Challenge, in which we participated, with the aim to address the following two problems: (a) to identify the top 60, 40, and 20 genes of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo that contain the most spatial information and (b) to reconstruct the 3-D arrangement of the embryo using information from those genes. We developed two independent techniques, leveraging machine learning models from least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) and deep neural networks (NNs), which are applied to high-dimensional single-cell sequencing data in order to accurately identify genes that contain spatial information. Our first technique, Lasso.TopX, utilizes the Lasso and ranking statistics and allows a user to define a specific number of features they are interested in. The NN approach utilizes weak supervision for linear regression to accommodate for uncertain or probabilistic training labels. We show, individually for both techniques, that we are able to identify important, stable, and a user-defined number of genes containing the most spatial information. The results from both techniques achieve high performance when reconstructing spatial information in D. melanogaster and also generalize to zebrafish (Danio rerio). Furthermore, we identified novel D. melanogaster genes that carry important positional information and were not previously suspected. We also show how the indirect use of the full datasets' information can lead to data leakage and generate bias in overestimating the model's performance. Lastly, we discuss the applicability of our approaches to other feature selection problems outside the realm of single-cell sequencing and the importance of being able to handle probabilistic training labels.

It is used for the purpose of delivering the newborn and the placenta through the abdominal wall incision (laparotomy) as well as Uterine incision (hysterotomy), followed by suture of the uterus and abdominal wall layers. Most common maternal complications internationally, according to literature were bleeding and wound infection. Most common fetal complications according to the literature were depressed Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration (APGAR) score, low blood pH and ICU admissions. The aim of this study is to determine the most common CS complications among all the deliveries at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC) in Jeddah in 2017 and to estimate maternal and fetal complication rates following CS. Comparing the rate of complication between residents and non-residents physicians performing a CS was tested as a secondary outcome. To the best of our knowledge, this is a novel research in this medical center at KAMC Jeddah that will aid in quality improvement in both clinical services and training activities of residents. The maternal and fetal complication rates were assessed in a cross-sectional chart review study. In order for this method to be achieved, a secondary data collection sheet was constructed to collect all eligible patient health records. This literature review was based on estimating the rate of CS complications for the mothers and their neonates that founded approximately 7% and 6%, respectively, where the procedure was either performed electively or emergently within the period of 1 January to 31\\xa0December 2017. Also, all patients with medical and surgical conditions were included while intrauterine fetal death was excluded.

We used datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas to compare miRNA expression patterns in samples with high and low TMB from patients with CRC. We created an miRNA-based signature index using the selection operator (LASSO) and least absolute shrinkage method from the training set. We used an independent test set as internal validation. We used real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to validate the miRNA-based signature classifier.\\nRESULTS\\nTwenty-seven samples from CRC patients underwent NGS to determine the TMB level. We identified four miRNA candidates in the training set for predicting TMB (N = 311). We used the test set (N = 204) for internal validation. The four-miRNA-based signature classifier was an accurate predictor of TMB, with accuracy 0.963 in the training set. In the test set, it was 0.902; and it was 0.946 in the total set. The classifier was superior to microsatellite instability (MSI) for predicting TMB in TCGA dataset.

In this study, we characterized the expression of VCX2, a member of the VCX/Y cancer/testis antigen family, in a large panel of normal tissues and tumors from multiple cancer types using immunohistochemical staining and RNA expression data. In normal tissues, VCX2 was detected in the germ cells of the testis at all stages of maturation but not in any somatic tissues. Among malignancies, VCX2 was only found in tumors of a small subset of melanoma patients and thus rarely expressed compared to other cancer/testis antigens such as GAGE and MAGE-A. The expression of VCX2 correlated with that of other VCX/Y genes. Importantly, we found that expression of VCX2 was inversely correlated with promoter methylation and could be activated by treatment with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor in multiple breast cancer and melanoma cell lines and a breast cancer patient-derived xenograft. The effect could be further potentiated by combining the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor with a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Our results show that the expression of VCX2 can be epigenetically induced in cancer cells and therefore could be an attractive target for immunotherapy of cancer.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND\\nConventional clinical detection methods such as CT, urine cytology, and ureteroscopy display low sensitivity and/or are invasive in the diagnosis of upper tract urinary carcinoma (UTUC), a factor precluding their use. Previous studies on urine biopsy have not shown satisfactory sensitivity and specificity in the application of both gene mutation or gene methylation panels. Therefore, these unfavorable factors call for an urgent need for a sensitive and non-invasive method for the diagnosis of UTUC.\\nMETHODS\\nIn this study, a total of 161 hematuria patients were enrolled with (n = 69) or without (n = 92) UTUC. High-throughput sequencing of 17 genes and methylation analysis for ONECUT2 CpG sites were combined as a liquid biopsy test panel. Further, a logistic regression prediction model that contained several significant features was used to evaluate the risk of UTUC in these patients.\\nRESULTS\\nIn total, 86 UTUC- and 64 UTUC+ case samples were enrolled for the analysis. A logistic regression analysis of significant features including age, the mutation status of TERT promoter, and ONECUT2 methylation level resulted in an optimal model with a sensitivity of 94.0%, a specificity of 93.1%, the positive predictive value of 92.2% and a negative predictive value of 94.7%. Notably, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.957 in the training dataset while internal validation produced an AUC of 0.962. It is worth noting that during follow-up, a patient diagnosed with ureteral inflammation at the time of diagnosis exhibiting both positive mutation and methylation test results was diagnosed with ureteral carcinoma 17 months after his enrollment.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThis work utilized the epigenetic biomarker ONECUT2 for the first time in the detection of UTUC and discovered its superior performance. To improve its sensitivity, we combined the biomarker with high-throughput sequencing of 17 genes test. It was found that the selected logistic regression model diagnosed with ureteral cancer can evaluate upper tract urinary carcinoma risk of patients with hematuria and outperform other existing panels in providing clinical recommendations for the diagnosis of UTUC. Moreover, its high negative predictive value is conducive to rule to exclude patients without UTUC.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND\\nTo date, breast cancer remains the most common malignant tumor in women. In recent years, a growing number of studies on polycomb proteins have been conducted. The Ring finger protein1 (RING1), an essential component of the polycomb family of proteins, plays vital roles in the tumorigenesis of various cancer types. However, further research is required in determining RING1 expression and prognostic value in breast cancer.\\nMETHOD\\nRING1 expression level in multiple cancer types was evaluated using the XENA and UALCAN databases. Real-time quantitative PCR (real-time qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to confirm this expression. The prognostic value was analyzed using our follow-up data and the Kaplan-Meier plotter website. RING1 co-expressed genes and its promoter methylation level were calculated using the cBioPortal and UALCAN online tools. The gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment were analyzed using the DAVID online analysis tool.\\nRESULT\\nRING1 expression was upregulated in CHOL (Bile Duct Cancer), ESCA (Esophageal Cancer), LIHC (Liver Cancer), and PCPG (Pheochromocytoma & Paraganglioma). However, its expression level was decreased in COAD (Colon Cancer), KICH (Kidney Chromophobe), KIRP (kidney papillary cell carcinoma), THCA (Thyroid Cancer), and BRCA (Breast carcinoma). RING1 low expression is an unfavorable prognostic factor in many cancer patients, especially in breast cancer patients. For breast cancer, the IHC result showed that RING1 protein expression significantly and negatively correlates with tumor size (P = 0.029), LNM (P = 0.017), TNM stage (P = 0.016), ER (P = 0.005), Ki67 (P = 0.015), and p53 status (P = 0.034). Moreover, the multivariate Cox regression model indicated that RING1 (P = 0.038) and ER (P = 0.029) expressions were independent prognostic markers for breast cancer. RING1 co-expressed genes were selected and included HDAC10, PIN1, CDK3, BAX, and BAD. GO analysis and KEGG pathway analyses revealed that RING1 related genes, were mainly enriched in \"regulation of transcription\", \"apoptotic process\", \"protein transport\", \"protein binding\", \"Notch signaling pathway\", and \"Homologous recombination\".\\nCONCLUSION\\nRING1 expression was downregulated in breast cancer, and its low expression was associated with worse disease outcomes. RING1 may act as a new prognostic biomarker for breast cancer.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'RNA binding proteins (RBPs) have been reported to be involved in cancer malignancy but related functions in glioma have been less studied. Herein, we screened 14 prognostic RBP genes and constructed a risk signature to predict the prognosis of glioma patients. Univariate Cox regression was used to identify overall survival (OS)-related RBP genes. Prognostic RBP genes were screened and used to establish the RBP-signature using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) method in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort. The 14 RBP genes signature showed robust and stable prognostic value in the TCGA training (n = 562) cohort and in three independent validation cohorts (Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas [CGGA]seq1, CGGAseq2, and GSE16011 datasets comprising 303, 619, and 250 glioma patients, respectively). Risk scores were calculated for each patient and high-risk gliomas were defined by the median risk score in each cohort. Survival analysis in subgroups of glioma patients showed that the RBP-signature retained its prognostic value in low-grade gliomas (LGGs) and glioblastomas (GBM)s. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis in each dataset and the meta cohort revealed that the RBP-signature stratification could efficiently recognize high-risk gliomas [Hazard Ratio (HR):3.662, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.187-4.208, p < 0.001] and was an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR:1.594, 95% CI: 1.244-2.043, p < 0.001). Biological process and KEGG pathway analysis revealed the RBP gene signature was associated with immune cell activation, the p53 signaling pathway, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and so on. Moreover, a nomogram model was constructed for clinical application of the RBP-signature, which showed stable predictive ability. In summary, the RBP-signature could be a robust indicator for prognostic evaluation and identifying high-risk glioma patients.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The neural crest cell (NCC) is a multipotent progenitor cell population that is sensitive to ethanol and is implicated in the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Studies have shown that sulforaphane (SFN) can prevent ethanol-induced apoptosis in NCCs. This study aims to investigate whether ethanol exposure can induce apoptosis in human NCCs (hNCCs) through epigenetically suppressing the expression of anti-apoptotic genes and whether SFN can restore the expression of anti-apoptotic genes and prevent apoptosis in ethanol-exposed hNCCs. We found that ethanol exposure resulted in a significant increase in the expression of DNMT3a and the activity of DNMTs. SFN treatment diminished the ethanol-induced upregulation of DNMT3a and dramatically reduced the activity of DNMTs in ethanol-exposed hNCCs. We also found that ethanol exposure induced hypermethylation at the promoter regions of two inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP), NAIP and XIAP, in hNCCs, which were prevented by co-treatment with SFN. SFN treatment also significantly diminished ethanol-induced downregulation of NAIP and XIAP in hNCCs. The knockdown of DNMT3a significantly enhanced the effects of SFN on preventing the ethanol-induced repression of NAIP and XIAP and apoptosis in hNCCs. These results demonstrate that SFN can prevent ethanol-induced apoptosis in hNCCs by preventing ethanol-induced hypermethylation at the promoter regions of the genes encoding the IAP proteins and diminishing ethanol-induced repression of NAIP and XIAP through modulating DNMT3a expression and DNMT activity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Proteostasis collapses during aging resulting, among other things, in the accumulation of damaged and aggregated proteins. The proteasome is the main cellular proteolytic system and plays a fundamental role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis. Our previous work has demonstrated that senescence and aging are related to a decline in proteasome content and activities, while its activation extends lifespan in vitro and in vivo in various species. However, the mechanisms underlying this age-related decline of proteasome function and the down-regulation in expression of its subunits remain largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the Forkhead box-O1 (FoxO1) transcription factor directly regulates the expression of a 20S proteasome catalytic subunit and, hence, proteasome activity. Specifically, we demonstrate that knockout of FoxO1, but not of FoxO3, in mice severely impairs proteasome activity in several tissues, while depletion of IRS1 enhances proteasome function. Importantly, we show that FoxO1 directly binds on the promoter region of the rate-limiting catalytic β5 proteasome subunit to regulate its expression. In summary, this study reveals the direct role of FoxO factors in the regulation of proteasome function and provides new insight into how FoxOs affect proteostasis and, in turn, longevity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is the master regulatory factor of preadipocyte differentiation. As a result of alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage, PPARγ gene generates multiple transcript variants encoding two protein isoforms. Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) plays a negative role in preadipocyte differentiation. However, its underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrated that KLF2 inhibited the P1 promoter activity of the chicken PPARγ gene. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the P1 promoter harbored a conserved putative KLF2 binding site, and mutation analysis showed that the KLF2 binding site was required for the KLF2-mediated transcription inhibition of the P1 promoter. ChIP, EMSA, and reporter gene assays showed that KLF2 could directly bind to the P1 promoter regardless of methylation status and reduced the P1 promoter activity. Consistently, histone modification analysis showed that H3K9me2 was enriched and H3K27ac was depleted in the P1 promoter upon KLF2 overexpression in ICP1 cells. Furthermore, gene expression analysis showed that KLF2 overexpression reduced the endogenous expression of PPARγ transcript variant 1 (PPARγ1), which is driven by the P1 promoter, in DF1 and ICP1 cells, and that the inhibition of ICP1 cell differentiation by KLF2 overexpression was accompanied by the downregulation of PPARγ1 expression. Taken together, our results demonstrated that KLF2 inhibits chicken preadipocyte differentiation at least inpart via direct downregulation of PPARγ1 expression.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Androgen-Driven Fusion Genes and Chimeric Transcripts in Prostate Cancer.',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'Androgens are steroid hormones governing the male reproductive development and function. As such, androgens and the key mediator of their effects, androgen receptor (AR), have a leading role in many diseases. Prostate cancer is a major disease where AR and its transcription factor function affect a significant number of patients worldwide. While disease-related AR-driven transcriptional programs are connected to the presence and activity of the receptor itself, also novel modes of transcriptional regulation by androgens are exploited by cancer cells. One of the most intriguing and ingenious mechanisms is to bring previously unconnected genes under the control of AR. Most often this occurs through genetic rearrangements resulting in fusion genes where an androgen-regulated promoter area is combined to a protein-coding area of a previously androgen-unaffected gene. These gene fusions are distinctly frequent in prostate cancer compared to other common solid tumors, a phenomenon still requiring an explanation. Interestingly, also another mode of connecting androgen regulation to a previously unaffected gene product exists via transcriptional read-through mechanisms. Furthermore, androgen regulation of fusion genes and transcripts is not linked to only protein-coding genes. Pseudogenes and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can also be affected by androgens and de novo functions produced. In this review, we discuss the prevalence, molecular mechanisms, and functional evidence for androgen-regulated prostate cancer fusion genes and transcripts. We also discuss the clinical relevance of especially the most common prostate cancer fusion gene TMPRSS2-ERG, as well as present open questions of prostate cancer fusions requiring further investigation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) often cohabite at interfaces shared by humans and wildlife, interacting with wild canids as predators, prey, competitors and reservoirs of several multi-host pathogens, such as canid-borne micro and macro parasites that could impact on wildlife, livestock and public health. However, spatio-temporal patterns of indirect interactions as promoters of pathogen transfer between domestic and wild canids are largely unknown. In this study, we used camera traps to describe the activity patterns and habitat use of dogs, chilla (Lycalopex griseus) and culpeo (Lycalopex culpaeus) foxes and identify the local-scale factors that may affect the frequency of dog-fox interactions through an anthropization gradient of the Coquimbo region, Chile. We assessed local-scale variables that may predict the number of interactions between dogs and foxes, and compared the time interval between dog-culpeo and dog-chilla interactions. Our findings suggested that closeness to urbanized zones predicts the frequency of indirect interactions between dogs and foxes. We found higher number of dog-fox interactions (60 interactions) at a periurban site adjacent to two coastal towns (Tongoy and Guanaqueros), compared to other two more undisturbed sites (12 interactions) increasingly distanced from urbanized areas. We showed that dogs interacted more frequently with chilla foxes (57 interactions) than with culpeo foxes (15 interactions), and the first interaction type occurred almost exclusively at the periurban site, where dogs and chillas were more frequently detected than in the other sites. We detected a marked temporal segregation between dogs and foxes, but dog-chilla interactions resulted in shorter time intervals (2.5 median days) compared to dog-culpeo interactions (7.6 median days), suggesting a higher potential risk of pathogen spillover between the first species pairing. Based on previous studies, we suggest periurban zones may constitute a potential focus of pathogen exposure between dog and fox populations in the study area. Our research contributes to improving the knowledge on the spatio-temporal patterns of interspecific contact between invasive and native carnivores within the context of multi-host pathogen dynamics. Our outcomes will inform theoretical epidemiological models designed to predict and minimize the contact risk between domestic and threatened species, guiding effective control strategies at the wildlife-domestic interface.',\n",

Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were used to explore the biological roles of CDMGs in HCC. Univariate Cox analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox analysis were performed to identify survival-related CDMGs (SR-CDMGs) and to build a predictive model. The importance of this model was assessed using Cox regression analysis, propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis and stratification analysis. A validation group from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was constructed to further validate the model.\\nRESULTS\\nFour SR-CDMGs were identified and used to build the predictive model. The risk score of this model was calculated as follows: risk score = (0.01489826 × methylation level of WDR69) + (0.15868618 × methylation level of HOXB4) + (0.16674959 × methylation level of CDKL2) + (0.16689301 × methylation level of HOXA10). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients in the low-risk group had a significantly longer overall survival (OS; log-rank P-value =0.00071). The Cox model multivariate analysis and PSM analysis identified the risk score as an independent prognostic factor (P<0.05). Stratified analysis results further confirmed this model performed well. By analyzing the validation group, the results of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and survival analysis further validated this model.\\nCONCLUSION\\nOur DNA methylation-based prognosis predictive model is effective and reliable in predicting prognosis for patients with HCC.',\n",

Excessive use of Bt δ-endotoxins in the field is delimiting its insecticidal potential.

Initial screening of putative transgenic cotton plants was done through amplification, histochemical staining and immunostrip assay. The mRNA expression of Vip3Aa gene was increased to be ninefold in transgenic cotton line L6P3 than non-transgenic control while ASAL expression was found to be fivefold higher in transgenic line L34P2 as compared to non-transgenic control. The maximum Vip3Aa concentration was observed in transgenic line L6P3. Two copy numbers in homozygous form at chromosome number 9 and one copy number in hemizygous form at chromosome number 10 was observed in transgenic line L6P3 through fluorescent in situ hybridization. Significant variation was observed in transgenic cotton lines for morphological characteristics, whereas physiological parameters of plants and fiber characteristics (as assessed by scanning electron microscopic) remained comparable in transgenic and non-transgenic cotton lines. Leaf-detach bioassay showed that all the transgenic lines were significantly resistant to Helicoverpa armigera showing mortality rates between 78% and 100%.

During ALI, the function of males absent on the first (MOF) has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we unveiled the expression pattern of MOF during carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 )-induced ALI and role of MOF in the regulation of liver regeneration. In the process of ALI, MOF is significantly overexpressed in the liver injury area. Knockdown of Mof attenuated CCl4 -induced ALI, and promoted liver cell proliferation, hepatic stellate cell activation and aggregation to the injured area, and liver fibrosis. Simultaneously, overexpression of Mof aggravated liver dysfunction caused by ALI. By directly binding to the promoter, MOF suppressed the transcriptional activation of Igf1. Knockdown of Mof promotes the expression of Igf1 and activates the Insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling pathway in the liver. Through this pathway, Knockdown of Mof reduces CCl4 -induced ALI and promotes liver regeneration. Our results provide the first demonstration for MOF contributing to ALI. Further understanding of the role of MOF in ALI may lead to new therapeutic strategies for ALI.',\n",

Antibiotic stress induces the expression of an integrase that excises and integrates cassettes, and this unique recombination and expression system is thought to allow bacteria to 'evolve on demand' in response to antibiotic pressure. To test this hypothesis, we inserted a custom three-cassette integron into Pseudomonas aeruginosa and used experimental evolution to measure the impact of integrase activity on adaptation to gentamicin. Crucially, integrase activity accelerated evolution by increasing the expression of a gentamicin resistance cassette through duplications and by eliminating redundant cassettes.

       "  'abstract': 'Ubiquitin-specific protease 39 (USP39) is frequently overexpressed in a variety of cancers, and involved in the regulation of various biological processes, such as cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis and pre-messenger RNA splicing. Nevertheless, the biological roles and mechanisms of USP39 in colon cancer remain largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed whether USP39 can be a molecular target for the treatment of colon cancer. Whilst overexpression of USP39 was detected in human colon cancer tissues and cell lines, USP39 knockdown was observed to inhibit the growth and subcutaneous tumor formation of colon cancer cells. Further analysis showed that USP39 knockdown can stabilize p21 by prolonging the half-life of p21 and by upregulating the promoter activity of p21. The RS domain and USP domain of USP39 were found to play an essential role. Additionally, our findings revealed that USP39 plays a regulatory role in the proliferation of colon cancer cells by the p53/p21/CDC2/cyclin B1 axis in a p21-dependent manner. Taken together, this study provided the theoretical basis that may facilitate the development of USP39 as a novel potential target of colon cancer therapy.',\n",

Whether there existed other epigenetic vulnerabilities that could serve as therapeutic targets remained unclear and promising. Here, we combined the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats functional screening results and multiple RCC datasets to identify JMJD6 as the potent target in RCC. JMJD6 expression correlated with poor survival outcomes of RCC patients and promoted RCC progression in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, aberrant p300 led to high JMJD6 expression, which activated a series of oncogenic crosstalk. Particularly, high-throughput sequencing data revealed that JMJD6 could assemble super-enhancers to drive a list of identity\\xa0genes in kidney cancer, including VEGFA, β-catenin, and SRC. Moreover, this JMJD6-mediated oncogenic effect could be suppressed by a novel JMJD6 inhibitor (SKLB325), which was further demonstrated in RCC cells, patient-derived organoid models, and in vivo. Given the probable overlapped crosstalk between JMJD6 signature and tyrosine kinase inhibitors downstream targets, targeting JMJD6 sensitized RCC to sunitinib and was synergistic when they were combined together. Collectively, this study indicated that targeting JMJD6 was an effective approach to treat RCC patients.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'β-thalassemias (β-thal) are a group of blood disorders caused by mutations in the β-globin gene (HBB) cluster. β-globin associates with α-globin to form adult hemoglobin (HbA, α2β2), the main oxygen-carrier in erythrocytes. When β-globin chains are absent or limiting, free α-globins precipitate and damage cell membranes, causing hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis. Clinical data show that severity of β-thal correlates with the number of inherited α-globin genes (HBA1 and HBA2), with α-globin gene deletions having a beneficial effect for patients. Here, we describe a novel strategy to treat β-thal based on genome editing of the α-globin locus in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Using CRISPR/Cas9, we combined 2 therapeutic approaches: (1) α-globin downregulation, by deleting the HBA2 gene to recreate an α-thalassemia trait, and (2) β-globin expression, by targeted integration of a β-globin transgene downstream the HBA2 promoter. First, we optimized the CRISPR/Cas9 strategy and corrected the pathological phenotype in a cellular model of β-thalassemia (human erythroid progenitor cell [HUDEP-2] β0). Then, we edited healthy donor HSPCs and demonstrated that they maintained long-term repopulation capacity and multipotency in xenotransplanted mice. To assess the clinical potential of this approach, we next edited β-thal HSPCs and achieved correction of α/β globin imbalance in HSPC-derived erythroblasts. As a safer option for clinical translation, we performed editing in HSPCs using Cas9 nickase showing precise editing with no InDels. Overall, we described an innovative CRISPR/Cas9 approach to improve α/β globin imbalance in thalassemic HSPCs, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies for β-thal.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Transcription factors are inextricably linked with histone deacetylases leading to compact chromatin. The Forkhead transcription factor Fkh1 is mainly a negative transcriptional regulator which affects cell cycle control, silencing of mating-type cassettes and induction of pseudohyphal growth in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Markedly, Fkh1 impinges chromatin architecture by recruiting large regulatory complexes. Implication of Fkh1 with transcriptional corepressor complexes remains largely unexplored. In this work we show that Fkh1 directly recruits corepressors Sin3 and Tup1 (but not Cyc8), providing evidence for its influence on epigenetic regulation. We also identified the specific domain of Fkh1 mediating Sin3 recruitment and substantiated that amino acids 51-125 of Fkh1 bind PAH2 of Sin3. Importantly, this part of Fkh1 overlaps with its Forkhead-associated domain (FHA). To analyse this domain in more detail, selected amino acids were replaced by alanine, revealing that hydrophobic amino acids L74 and I78 are important for Fkh1-Sin3 binding. In addition, we could prove Fkh1 recruitment to promoters of cell cycle genes CLB2 and SWI5. Notably, Sin3 is also recruited to these promoters but only in the presence of functional Fkh1. Our results disclose that recruitment of Sin3 to Fkh1 requires precisely positioned Fkh1/Sin3 binding sites which provide an extended view on the genetic control of cell cycle genes CLB2 and SWI5 and the mechanism of transcriptional repression by modulation of chromatin architecture at the G2/M transition.',\n",

Telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter (TERT-p) mutations have been detected in several types of human malignancies. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of TERT-p mutations in penile squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and their associations with clinicopathologic features.\\nMETHODS\\nIn this retrospective study, Sanger sequencing was performed to detect TERT-p mutations in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 37 patients with penile SCC, 16 patients with cutaneous SCC, and 4 patients with non-neoplastic penile/skin tissue. The expression of p16INK4a and Ki-67 was investigated via immunohistochemistry. Associations of TERT-p mutation with clinicopathological factors, immunohistochemical results, and clinical outcome were statistically analyzed.\\nRESULTS\\nRecurrent TERT-p mutations were identified in 18 out of 37 (48.6%) penile SCCs, including all 3 carcinoma in situ cases. TERT-p mutations were significantly more frequent in non-human papilloma virus (HPV)-related penile SCC types than in non-HPV-related penile SCC based on both histologic classification and p16INK4a immunoreactivity. Furthermore, TERT-p mutation was associated with a low histologic grade, low mitotic count, absence of necrosis, low Ki-67/MIB-1 labeling index, and absence of lymph node or distant metastasis.\\nCONCLUSION\\nOur study shows TERT-p mutations are the most frequent somatic mutations in penile SCC. In addition, TERT-p mutations are far more frequent in non-HPV-related penile SCC than in HPV-related penile SCC, indicating TERT-p mutations may have a role in tumorigenesis distinct from HPV-related penile SCC.',\n",

Recently, agmatine, the endogenous decarboxylated L-arginine, has gained attention as a pleiotropic agent that modulates the diabetes-associated decline in quality of life, and exhibited varied protective biological effects. Diabetes was induced by a single streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg/kg, i.p.) injection. When diabetes was verified, the animals were randomly allocated into three groups (16 rat each); diabetic, agmatine-treated diabetic (1 mg/kg, daily, for 12 weeks), and control group. Blood glucose homeostasis, retinal redox status, apoptotic parameters, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), nitric oxide (NO), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glutamate, glutamine, glutamine synthase (GS) activity, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) pathways were assayed biochemically. Retinal vascular permeability was measured. Retinal morphology was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Retinal N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor1 (NMDAR1) and glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) mRNA were quantified. Glucose transporter 1, pro-caspase3, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression were quantified by immunohistochemistry. Chronic agmatine treatment abrogated STZ-induced retinal neurodegeneration features including gliosis, and neuronal apoptosis, restored retinal vascular permeability, mostly through antioxidant, anti-apoptotic capacity, abolishing glutamate excitotoxicity, modulating the activity of NMDARs, MAPKs/NFκB, and NOS/NO pathways.

       "  'title': 'A natural language processing and deep learning approach to identify child abuse from pediatric electronic medical records.',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'Child physical abuse is a leading cause of traumatic injury and death in children. In 2017, child abuse was responsible for 1688 fatalities in the United States, of 3.5 million children referred to Child Protection Services and 674,000 substantiated victims. While large referral hospitals maintain teams trained in Child Abuse Pediatrics, smaller community hospitals often do not have such dedicated resources to evaluate patients for potential abuse. Moreover, identification of abuse has a low margin of error, as false positive identifications lead to unwarranted separations, while false negatives allow dangerous situations to continue. This context makes the consistent detection of and response to abuse difficult, particularly given subtle signs in young, non-verbal patients. Here, we describe the development of artificial intelligence algorithms that use unstructured free-text in the electronic medical record-including notes from physicians, nurses, and social workers-to identify children who are suspected victims of physical abuse. Importantly, only the notes from time of first encounter (e.g.: birth, routine visit, sickness) to the last record before child protection team involvement were used. This allowed us to develop an algorithm using only information available prior to referral to the specialized child protection team. The study was performed in a multi-center referral pediatric hospital on patients screened for abuse within five different locations between 2015 and 2019. Of 1123 patients, 867 records were available after data cleaning and processing, and 55% were abuse-positive as determined by a multi-disciplinary team of clinical professionals. These electronic medical records were encoded with three natural language processing (NLP) algorithms-Bag of Words (BOW), Word Embeddings (WE), and Rules-Based (RB)-and used to train multiple neural network architectures. The BOW and WE encodings utilize the full free-text, while RB selects crucial phrases as identified by physicians. The best architecture was selected by average classification accuracy for the best performing model from each train-test split of a cross-validation experiment. Natural language processing coupled with neural networks detected cases of likely child abuse using only information available to clinicians prior to child protection team referral with average accuracy of 0.90±0.02 and average area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) 0.93±0.02 for the best performing Bag of Words models. The best performing rules-based models achieved average accuracy of 0.77±0.04 and average ROC-AUC 0.81±0.05, while a Word Embeddings strategy was severely limited by lack of representative embeddings. Importantly, the best performing model had a false positive rate of 8%, as compared to rates of 20% or higher in previously reported studies. This artificial intelligence approach can help screen patients for whom an abuse concern exists and streamline the identification of patients who may benefit from referral to a child protection team. Furthermore, this approach could be applied to develop computer-aided-diagnosis platforms for the challenging and often intractable problem of reliably identifying pediatric patients suffering from physical abuse.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Previously, we reported that cellular transcription factor ZASC1 facilitates DNA-dependent/RNA-independent recruitment of HIV-1 TAT and the cellular elongation factor P-TEFb to the HIV-1 promoter and is a critical factor in regulating HIV-1 transcriptional elongation (PLoS Path e1003712). Here we report that cellular transcription factor ZBTB2 is a novel repressor of HIV-1 gene expression. ZBTB2 strongly co-immunoprecipitated with ZASC1 and was dramatically relocalized by ZASC1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Mutations abolishing ZASC1/ZBTB2 interaction prevented ZBTB2 nuclear relocalization. We show that ZBTB2-induced repression depends on interaction of cellular histone deacetylases (HDACs) with the ZBTB2 POZ domain. Further, ZASC1 interaction specifically recruited ZBTB2 to the HIV-1 promoter, resulting in histone deacetylation and transcription repression. Depleting ZBTB2 by siRNA knockdown or CRISPR/CAS9 knockout in T cell lines enhanced transcription from HIV-1 vectors lacking Vpr, but not from these vectors expressing Vpr. Since HIV-1 Vpr activates the viral LTR by inducing the ATR kinase/DNA damage response pathway, we investigated ZBTB2 response to Vpr and DNA damaging agents. Expressing Vpr or stimulating the ATR pathway with DNA damaging agents impaired ZASC1's ability to localize ZBTB2 to the nucleus. Moreover, the effects of DNA damaging agents and Vpr on ZBTB2 localization could be blocked by ATR kinase inhibitors. Critically, Vpr and DNA damaging agents decreased ZBTB2 binding to the HIV-1 promoter and increased promoter histone acetylation. Thus, ZBTB2 is recruited to the HIV-1 promoter by ZASC1 and represses transcription, but ATR pathway activation leads to ZBTB2 removal from the promoter, cytoplasmic sequestration and activation of viral transcription. Together, our data show that ZASC1/ZBTB2 integrate the functions of TAT and Vpr to maximize HIV-1 gene expression.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'CONTEXT.—\\nDelayed recognition of acute kidney injury (AKI) results in poor outcomes in military and civilian burn-trauma care. Poor predictive ability of urine output (UOP) and creatinine contribute to the delayed recognition of AKI.\\nOBJECTIVE.—\\nTo determine the impact of point-of-care (POC) AKI biomarker enhanced by machine learning (ML) algorithms in burn-injured and trauma patients.\\nDESIGN.—\\nWe conducted a 2-phased study to develop and validate a novel POC device for measuring neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and creatinine from blood samples. In phase I, 40 remnant plasma samples were used to evaluate the analytic performance of the POC device. Next, phase II enrolled 125 adults with either burns that were 20% or greater of total body surface area or nonburn trauma with suspicion of AKI for clinical validation. We applied an automated ML approach to develop models predicting AKI, using a combination of NGAL, creatinine, and/or UOP as features.\\nRESULTS.—\\nPoint-of-care NGAL (mean [SD] bias: 9.8 [38.5] ng/mL, P = .10) and creatinine results (mean [SD] bias: 0.28 [0.30] mg/dL, P = .18) were comparable to the reference method. NGAL was an independent predictor of AKI (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.08-5.20; P = .01). The optimal ML model achieved an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 96%, 92.3%, and 97.7%, respectively, with NGAL, creatinine, and UOP as features. Area under the receiver operator curve was 0.96.\\nCONCLUSIONS.—\\nPoint-of-care NGAL testing is feasible and produces results comparable to reference methods. Machine learning enhanced the predictive performance of AKI biomarkers including NGAL and was superior to the current techniques.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns are created by transcription factors that recruit methylation and demethylation enzymes to cis-regulatory elements. To date, it is not known whether transcription factors are needed to continuously maintain methylation profiles in development and mature tissues or whether they only establish these marks during organ development. We queried the role of the pioneer factor FoxA in generating hypomethylated DNA at liver enhancers. We discovered a set of FoxA-binding sites that undergo regional, FoxA-dependent demethylation during organ development. Conditional ablation of FoxA genes in the adult liver demonstrated that continued FoxA presence was not required to maintain the hypomethylated state, even when massive cell proliferation was induced. This study provides strong evidence for the stable, epigenetic nature of tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns directed by lineage-determining transcription factors during organ development.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Small molecules that promote the formation of new myelinating oligodendrocytes from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are potential therapeutics for demyelinating diseases. We recently established inhibition of specific cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes and resulting accumulation of 8,9-unsaturated sterols as a unifying mechanism through which many such molecules act. To identify more potent sterol enhancers of oligodendrocyte formation, we synthesized a collection of 8,9-unsaturated sterol derivatives and found that 24,25-epoxylanosterol potently promoted oligodendrocyte formation. In OPCs, 24,25-epoxylanosterol was metabolized to 24,25-epoxycholesterol via the epoxycholesterol shunt pathway. Increasing flux through the epoxycholesterol shunt using genetic manipulation or small-molecule inhibition of lanosterol synthase (LSS) increased endogenous 24,25-epoxycholesterol levels and OPC differentiation. Notably, exogenously supplied 24,25-epoxycholesterol promoted oligodendrocyte formation despite lacking an 8,9-unsaturation. This work highlights epoxycholesterol shunt usage, controlled by inhibitors of LSS, as a target to promote oligodendrocyte formation. Additionally, sterols beyond the 8,9-unsaturated sterols, including 24,25-epoxycholesterol, drive oligodendrocyte formation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The disease-initiating molecular events for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a multifactorial retinal disease affecting many millions of elderly individuals worldwide, are still unknown. Of the over 30 risk and protective loci so far associated with AMD through whole genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the Age-Related Maculopathy Susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) gene locus represents one of the most highly associated risk regions for AMD. A unique insertion/deletion (in/del) sequence located immediately upstream of the High Temperature Requirement A1 (HTRA1) gene in this region confers high risk for AMD. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we identified that two Gtf2i-β/δ transcription factor isoforms bind to the cis-element 5'- ATTAATAACC-3' contained in this in/del sequence. The binding of these transcription factors leads to enhanced upregulation of transcription of the secretory serine protease HTRA1 in transfected cells and AMD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Overexpression of Htra1 in mice using a CAG-promoter demonstrated increased blood concentration of Htra1 protein, caused upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and produced a choroidal neovascularization (CNV)-like phenotype. Finally, a comparison of 478 AMD patients to 481 healthy, age-matched controls from Japan, India, Australia, and the USA showed a statistically increased level of secreted HTRA1 blood concentration in AMD patients compared with age-matched controls. Taken together, these results suggest a common mechanism across ethnicities whereby increased systemic blood circulation of secreted serine protease HTRA1 leads to subsequent degradation of Bruch's membrane and eventual CNV in AMD.\",\n",

Irradiation of the subventricular zone (SVZ) has recently been discussed as a promising concept as this tissue harbors stem cells which seem to play a role in the initiation and recurrence of GBM. In this study, we retrospectively examined the relationship of SVZ irradiation dose and survival in a large, homogeneous GBM patient cohort.\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\nWe included 200 GBM patients who had been treated at our institution with trimodal therapy (surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy) between 2009 and 2020. The SVZ was delineated, and dose-volume histograms were calculated and extracted. Tumors were classified according to their contact with the SVZ. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis, and univariable and multivariable Cox regression (MVA) were used to determine prognostic effects on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).\\nRESULTS\\nMedian PFS of the study group was 7.2\\xa0months; median OS was 15.1\\xa0months. In MVA (with mean dose to the ipsilateral SVZ as a continuous covariable), PFS was significantly lower for patients with a Karnofsky performance status (KPS)\\xa0<\\xa070% and without MGMT promoter methylation. Factors prognostic for shorter OS were old age, lower KPS, unmethylated MGMT status, SVZ contact and biopsy instead of subtotal- or gross total resection. There was no significant correlation between survival and SVZ dose.\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn this cohort, an increased mean dose to the ipsilateral or contralateral SVZ did not correlate with improved survival in irradiated GBM patients in MVA. Patients whose tumor directly involved the SVZ showed worse OS in MVA.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Human olfactory ecto-mesenchymal stem cells (hOE-MSCs) derived from the human olfactory mucosa (OM) can be easily isolated and expanded in cultures while their immense plasticity is maintained. To mitigate ethical concerns, the hOE-MSCs can be also transplanted across allogeneic barriers, making them desirable cells for clinical applications. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of administering the hOE-MSCs on a spinal cord injury (SCI) model of rats. These cells were accordingly isolated and cultured, and then treated in the neurobasal medium containing serum-free Dulbecco's Modified Essential Medium (DMEM) and Ham's F-12 Medium (DMEM/F12) with 2% B27 for two days. Afterwards, the pre-induced cells were incubated in N2B27 with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), fibroblast growth factor 8b (FGF8b), sonic hedgehog (SHH), and ascorbic acid (vitamin C) for six days. The efficacy of the induced cells was additionally evaluated using immunocytochemistry (ICC) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The differentiated cells were similarly transplanted into the SC contusions. Functional recovery was further conducted on a weekly basis for eight consecutive weeks. Moreover, cell integration was assessed via conventional histology and ICC, whose results revealed the expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) marker at the induction stage. According to the RT-PCR findings, the highest expression level of insulin gene-enhancer protein (islet-1), oligodendrocyte transcription factor (Olig2), and homeobox protein HB9 was observed at the induction stage. The number of engraftment cells also rose (approximately by 2.5 % ± 0.1) in the motor neuron-like cells derived from the hOE-MSCs-grafted group compared with the OE-MSCs-grafted one. The functional analysis correspondingly revealed that locomotor and sensory scores considerably improved in the rats in the treatment group. These findings suggested that motor neuron-like cells derived from the hOE-MSCs could be utilized as an alternative cell-based therapeutic strategy for SCI.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Computer-aided detection (CADe) of pulmonary nodules is an effective approach for early detection of lung cancer. However, due to the low contrast of lung computed tomography (CT) images, the interference of blood vessels and classifications, CADe has the problems of low detection rate and high false-positive rate (FPR). To solve these problems, a novel method using Hessian information and multi-scale reverse Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) (Hessian-MRLoG) is proposed and developed in this work. Also, since the intensity distribution of the LoG operator and the lung nodule in CT images are inconsistent, and their shapes are mismatched, a multi-scale reverse Laplacian of Gaussian (MRLoG) is constructed. In addition, in order to enhance the effectiveness of target detection, the second-order partial derivatives of MRLoG are partially adjusted by introducing an adjustment factor. On this basis, the Hessian-MRLoG model is developed, and a novel elliptic filter is designed. Ultimately, in this study, the method of Hessian-MRLoG filtering is proposed and developed for pulmonary nodule detection. To verify its effectiveness and accuracy, the proposed method was used to analyze the LUNA16 dataset. The experimental results revealed that the proposed method had an accuracy of 93.6% and produced 1.0 false positives per scan (FPs/scan), indicating that the proposed method can improve the detection rate and significantly reduce the FPR. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential for application in the detection, localization and labeling of other lesion areas.',\n",

Following Vibrio parahaemolyticus challenge, the expression levels of PmTRIM9 mRNA were significantly down-regulated in tested tissues. RNA interference and recombinant protein injection experiments were performed to explore the function of PmTRIM9, and the results showed it could facilitate V. parahaemolyticus replication and lead P. monodon more vulnerable to V. parahaemolyticus challenge. The dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that PmTRIM9 possessed the ability to inhibit the promoter activity in HEK293\\u2009T cells.

Further studies showed that knockdown of PmRelish promoted the V. parahaemolyticus infection and decreased the expression of specific antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), including PmCRU5, PmCRU7, PmALF6, PmALF3, PmLYZ and PmPEN5. However, knockdown of PmTRIM9 increased expression levels of the same AMPs, but except for PmCRU5, indicating that PmTRIM9 may negatively regulate the PmRelish-mediated expression of AMPs. All these results suggest that PmTRIM9 was involved in facilitating V. parahaemolyticus infection by inhibition of Relish pathway in P. monodon.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Metabolic and genomic characteristics of polyamines (PAs) may be associated with the induction of cold tolerance (CT) responses in plants. Characteristics of PAs encoding genes in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) and their function under cold stress (CS) are currently unknown. In this study, the potential role of PAs along with the antioxidative defense systems were assessed in two chickpea genotypes (Sel96th11439, cold-tolerant and ILC533, cold-sensitive) under CS conditions. Six days after exposure to CS, the leaf H2O2 content and electrolyte leakage index increased in the sensitive genotype by 47.7 and 59 %, respectively, while these values decreased or remained unchanged, respectively, in the tolerant genotype. In tolerant genotype, the enhanced activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) (by 50 %) was accompanied by unchanged activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) and catalase (CAT) as well as the accumulation of glutathione (GSH) (by 43 %) on the sixth day of CS. Higher levels of putrescine (Put) (322 %), spermidine (Spd) (45 %), spermine (Spm) (69 %) and the highest ratio of Put/(Spd + Spm) were observed in tolerant genotype compared to the sensitive one on the sixth day of CS. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) accumulation was 74 % higher in tolerant genotype compared to the sensitive one on the sixth day of CS. During CS, the activity of diamine oxidase (DAO) and polyamine oxidase (PAO) increased in tolerant (by 3.02- and 2.46-fold) and sensitive (by 2.51- and 2.8-fold) genotypes, respectively, in comparison with the respective non-stressed plants (normal conditions). The highest activity of DAO and PAO in the tolerant genotype was accompanied by PAs decomposition and a peak in GABA content on the sixth day of CS. The analysis of chickpea genome revealed the presence of five PAs biosynthetic genes, their chromosomal locations, and cis-regulatory elements. A significant increase in transcript levels of arginine decarboxylase (ADC) (24.26- and 7.96-fold), spermidine synthase 1 (SPDS1) (3.03- and 1.53-fold), SPDS2 (5.5- and 1.62-fold) and spermine synthase (SPMS) (3.92- and 1.65-fold) genes was detected in tolerant and sensitive genotypes, respectively, whereas the expression of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) genes decreased significantly under CS conditions in both genotypes. Leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid contents exhibited declining trends in the sensitive genotype, while these photosynthetic pigments were stable in the tolerant genotype due to the superior performance of defensive processes under CS conditions. Overall, these results suggested the specific roles of putative PAs genes and PAs metabolism in development of effective CT responses in chickpea.',\n",

Compared to biopsy, several studies demonstrated favorable performance of noninvasive multianalyte serum fibrosis marker panels [fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index] and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), but suggested cutoffs vary widely. Our objective was to evaluate FIB-4 index and APRI and their component tests for staging fibrosis in our HCV-infected population and to determine practical cutoffs to help triage an influx of patients requiring treatment.\\nMETHODS\\nTransient elastography (TE) results from 1731 HCV-infected patients were mapped to an F0-F4 equivalent scale. Each patient's APRI and FIB-4 index were calculated. Areas under the receiver operator curve (AUROCs) and false-positive and false-negative rates were calculated to retrospectively compare the performance of the indices and their component tests.\\nRESULTS\\nThe highest AUROCs for distinguishing severe (F3-F4) from mild-to-moderate (F0-F2) fibrosis had overlapping 95% CIs: APRI (0.77; 0.74-0.79), FIB-4 index (0.76; 0.73-0.78), and AST (0.74; 0.72-0.77).

Published cutoffs for APRI and FIB-4 index would have been inappropriate in our population, with false-negative rates as high as 11%. For our purposes, no serum fibrosis marker was sufficiently sensitive to rule-out significant fibrosis, but cutoffs developed for AST, FIB-4 index, and APRI all had specificities of 79.2%-80.3% for ruling-in severe fibrosis and could be used to triage 1/3 of our population for treatment without waiting for TE or liver biopsy.\",\n",

We aimed to explore if a digital handle with instant haptic feedback on traction force would reduce the neonatal risk during low or mid station VAD.\\nMETHODS\\nA two centre, randomised superiority trial at Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden, 2016-2018. Cases were randomised bedside to either a conventional or a digital handle attached to a Bird metal cup (50\\u2009mm, 80\\u2009kPa). The digital handle measured applied force including an instant notification by vibration when high levels of traction force were predicted according to a predefined algorithm. Primary outcome was a composite of hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, intracranial haemorrhage, seizures, death and/or subgaleal hematoma. Three hundred eighty low and mid VAD in each group were estimated to decrease primary outcome from six to 2 %.\\nRESULTS\\nAfter 2 years, an interim analyse was undertaken. Meeting the inclusion criteria, 567 vacuum extractions were randomized to the use of a digital handle (n\\u2009=\\u2009296) or a conventional handle (n\\u2009=\\u2009271). Primary outcome did not differ between the two groups: (2.7% digital handle vs 2.6% conventional handle). The incidence of primary outcome differed significantly between the two delivery wards (4% vs 0.9%, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). A recalculation of power revealed that 800 cases would be needed in each group to show a decrease in primary outcome from three to 1 %. This was not feasible, and the study therefore closed.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThe incidence of primary outcome was lower than estimated and the study was underpowered. However, the difference between the two delivery wards might reflect varying degree of experience of the technical equipment. An objective documentation of the extraction procedure is an attractive alternative in respect to safety and clinical training. To demonstrate improved safety, a multicentre study is required to reach an adequate cohort.

Morphologically it is difficult to distinguish metastatic HNSCC from a second primary tumor which presents a significant diagnostic challenge. Differentiation of those two malignancies is important because the recommended treatments for metastatic HNSCC and primary LuSCC differ significantly. We investigated if the quantification of the promotor methylation status in HNSCC and LuSCC differs.\\nMETHODS\\nPrimary HNSCC (N\\xa0=\\u200936) and LuSCC (N\\xa0=\\u200917) were included in this study.

       "  'abstract': 'Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers around the world and endangers human health seriously. Liver metastasis is an important factor affecting the long-term prognosis of CRC and the specific mechanism of CRLM (colorectal cancer with liver metastasis) is not fully understood. LZTS1 has been found dysregulated in many cancers, especially in CRC. Theories suggested that hypermethylation of the promoter regions of LZTS1 was responsible for LZTS1 abnormal expression in multiple malignant tumors. Although the role of LZTS1 in CRC cell proliferation has been reported, its role in CRLM remains unclear. Numerous studies reported Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) could regulate the gene expression level by regulating gene methylation status in many tumors. However, whether there were lncRNAs could change the methylation status of LZTS1 or not in CRLM was unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether there are lncRNAs can regulate the expression of LZTS1 through affecting DNA methylation in CRLM. We found that upregulated Lnc-LALC in CRC was negatively correlated with LZTS1 expression, and Lnc-LALC could regulate LZTS1 expression in both mRNA and protein level in our study. Functionally, Lnc-LALC enhanced the CRC cells metastasis ability in vitro and vivo through inhibiting the expression of LZTS1. Furthermore, the precise mechanisms exploration showed that lnc-LALC could recruit DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) to the LZTS1 promoter by combining with Enhancer of zeste homolog 2(EZH2) and then altered the expression of LZTS1 via DNMTs-mediated DNA methylation. Collectively, our data demonstrated the important role of Lnc-LALC/ LZTS1 axis in CRLM development.',\n",

Although the transcription of MYB has been well studied, its detailed underlying regulatory mechanisms still remain elusive. Here, we detected the long-range interaction between the upstream regions, -34k and -88k, and the MYB promoter in K562, U937, and HL-60 cells using circularized chromosome conformation capture (4C) assay, which declined when MYB was downregulated during chemical-induced differentiation. The enrichment of enhancer markers, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, and enhancer activity at the -34k and -88k regions were confirmed by ChIP-qPCR and luciferase assay respectively. ChIP-qPCR showed the dynamic binding of GATA1, TAL1, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPβ) at -34k and -88k during differentiation of K562 cells. Epigenome editing by a CRISPR-Cas9-based method showed that H3K27ac at -34k enhanced TF binding and MYB expression, while DNA methylation inhibited MYB expression. Taken together, our data revealed that enhancer elements at -34k are required for MYB expression, TF binding, and epigenetic modification are closely involved in this process in human myeloid leukemia cells.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Osteoporosis (OP) is a common skeletal disease involving low bone mineral density (BMD) that often leads to fragility fracture, and its development is affected by multiple cellular pathologies and associated with marked epigenetic alterations of osteogenic genes. Proper physical exercise is beneficial for bone health and OP and reportedly possesses epigenetic modulating capacities; however, whether the protective effects of exercise on OP involve epigenetic mechanisms is unclear. Here, we report that epigenetic derepression of nuclear factor erythroid derived 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), a master regulator of oxidative stress critically involved in the pathogenesis of OP, mediates the significant osteoprotective effects of running exercise (RE) in a mouse model of OP induced by ovariectomy. We showed that Nrf2 gene knockout (Nfe2l2-/-) ovariectomized mice displayed a worse BMD reduction than the controls, identifying Nrf2 as a critical antiosteoporotic factor. Further, femoral Nrf2 was markedly repressed with concomitant DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) 1/Dnmt3a/Dnmt3b elevations and Nrf2 promoter hypermethylation in both patients with OP and ovariectomized mice. However, daily 1-h treadmill RE significantly corrected epigenetic alterations, recovered Nrf2 loss and improved the femur bone mass and trabecular microstructure. Consistently, RE also normalized the adverse expression of major osteogenic factors, including osteoblast/osteoclast markers, Nrf2 downstream antioxidant enzymes and proinflammatory cytokines. More importantly, the RE-conferred osteoprotective effects observed in the wild-type control mice were largely abolished in the Nfe2l2-/- mice. Thus, Nrf2 repression due to aberrant Dnmt elevation and subsequent Nrf2 promoter hypermethylation is likely an important epigenetic feature of the pathogenesis of OP, and Nrf2 derepression is essential for the antiosteoporotic effects of RE.',\n",

Conventional assays to map regulatory elements via open chromatin analysis of primary tissues is hindered by sample heterogeneity. Single cell analysis of accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) can overcome this limitation. However, the high-level noise of each single cell profile and the large volume of data pose unique computational challenges. Here, we introduce SnapATAC, a software package for analyzing scATAC-seq datasets. SnapATAC dissects cellular heterogeneity in an unbiased manner and map the trajectories of cellular states. Using the Nyström method, SnapATAC can process data from up to a million cells. Furthermore, SnapATAC incorporates existing tools into a comprehensive package for analyzing single cell ATAC-seq dataset. As demonstration of its utility, SnapATAC is applied to 55,592 single-nucleus ATAC-seq profiles from the mouse secondary motor cortex.

The proposed method is ductile and can be tailored to return either linear or non-linear classifiers. Adjusting the eigenvalues, when freezing the eigenvectors entries, yields performances that are superior to those attained with standard methods restricted to operate with an identical number of free parameters.

Although dispensable for TCR-mediated repair, PAF1C is essential for transcription recovery after UV irradiation. We find that PAF1C promotes RNAPII pause release in promoter-proximal regions and subsequently acts as a processivity factor that stimulates transcription elongation throughout genes.

Recent findings suggest that the σ54 system, which includes σ54-loaded RNA polymerase and transcriptional activators called enhancer binding proteins (EBPs), might be a common regulator of natural product genes. Here, we explored this idea by analyzing a selected group of putative σ54 promoters identified in Myxococcus xanthus natural product gene clusters. We show that mutations in putative σ54-RNA polymerase binding regions and in putative Nla28 EBP binding sites dramatically reduce in vivo promoter activities in growing and developing cells. We also show in vivo promoter activities are reduced in a nla28 mutant, that Nla28 binds to wild-type fragments of these promoters in vitro, and that in vitro binding is lost when the Nla28 binding sites are mutated. Together, our results indicate that M. xanthus uses σ54 promoters for transcription of at least some of its natural product genes. Interestingly, the vast majority of experimentally confirmed and putative σ54 promoters in M. xanthus natural product loci are located within genes and not in intergenic sequences.',\n",

In our previous study, the chemopreventive potential of (E)-N-(2-(3, 5-Dimethoxystyryl) phenyl) furan-2-carboxamide (BK3C231) has been elucidated through its cytoprotective effects against DNA and mitochondrial damages in the human colon fibroblast CCD-18Co cell model. Therefore this study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying BK3C231-induced cytoprotection and the involvement of the Nrf2/ARE pathway. The cells were pretreated with BK3C231 before exposure to carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide (4NQO). BK3C231 increased the protein expression and activity of cytoprotective enzymes namely NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), as well as restoring the expression of glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) back to the basal level. Furthermore, dissociation of Nrf2 from its inhibitory protein, Keap1, and ARE promoter activity were upregulated in cells pretreated with BK3C231. Taken together, our findings suggest that BK3C231 exerts cytoprotection by activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway which leads to ARE-mediated upregulation of cytoprotective proteins.

The cyclic AMP responsive element-binding protein 3-like 4 (CREB3L4) is a transcription factor highly expressed in multiple human cancers. This study aimed to investigate the regulatory effects of CREB3L4 on GC progression and angiogenesis. CREB3L4 was overexpressed in GC tissues and cell lines, and was positively correlated with advanced tumor stage and poor survival in GC patients. The upregulation of CREB3L4 in GC cells increased cell viability, promoted cell proliferation, reduced apoptosis, enhanced cell migration and invasion, and induced the formation of tubule-like endothelial structures, whereas CREB3L4 knockdown impeded tumor cell growth, attenuated cell motility, and prevented human umbilical vein endothelial cells from forming tubule-like structures. In addition, mice inoculated with CREB3L4-deficient GC cells showed significantly suppressed tumor growth compared to the group harboring wild-type tumors. Further analysis revealed that CREB3L4 expression was positively correlated with the level of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in gastric tumors. CREB3L4 regulated the transcription activity of VEGFA by binding to its promoter. The downregulation of VEGFA eliminated CREB3L4-induced GC cell growth and movement, and the formation of endothelial structures; while VEGFA upregulation greatly induced the growth and movement of GC cells with CREB3L4 deficiency. In conclusion, CREB3L4 promoted gastric tumor progression and endothelial angiogenesis by transcriptionally activating the VEGFA promoter, suggesting that therapeutic potential of the CREB3L4/VEGFA axis in GC treatment.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Over the past decades, transposable elements (TEs) have been shown to play important roles shaping genome architecture and as major promoters of genetic diversification and evolution of species. Likewise, TE accumulation is tightly linked to heterochromatinization and centromeric dynamics, which can ultimately contribute to speciation. Despite growing efforts to characterize the repeat landscape of species, few studies have focused on mapping the accumulation profiles of TEs on chromosomes. The few studies on repeat accumulation profiles in populations are biased towards model organisms and inbred lineages. Here, we present a cytomolecular analysis of six mobilome-extracted elements on multiple individuals from a population of a species of wild-captured beetle, Dichotomius schiffleri, aiming to investigate patterns of TE accumulation and uncover possible trends of their chromosomal distribution. Compiling TE distribution data from several individuals allowed us to make generalizations regarding variation of TEs at the gross chromosome level unlikely to have been achieved using a single individual, or even from a whole-genome assembly. We found that (1) transposable elements have differential accumulation profiles on D. schiffleri chromosomes and (2) specific chromosomes have their own TE accumulation landscape. The remarkable variability of their genomic distribution suggests that TEs are likely candidates to contribute to the evolution of heterochromatin architecture and promote high genetic variability in species that otherwise display conserved karyotypes. Therefore, this variation likely contributed to genome evolution and species diversification in Dichotomius.',\n",

It is characterized as a progressive and irreversible brain disorder hampering memory and thinking, affecting the capacity to perform daily tasks leading to physical and cognitive incapacitation. The conventional treatment occurs by the oral route, but it presents relevant drawbacks such as low bioavailability, fast metabolism, limited brain exposure, and undesirable side effects. The intranasal route has been proposed as a promising alternative to deliver drugs and improve the Alzheimer's disease treatment. Still, there is not a clear alternative delivery system available in the market with advantageous bioavailability and safety. The aim of this review is to perform an overview on the strategies for drug intranasal delivery for Alzheimer's disease treatment. The advantages and disadvantages of this delivery route and the delivery systems developed so far are discussed. A special focus is given on the use of permeation enhancers, the types of intranasal drug delivery devices, as well as possible toxicity concerns.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Tamoxifen (TAM) resistance is a significant clinical challenge in endocrine therapies for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients. Cullin 4B (CUL4B), which acts as a scaffold protein in CUL4B-RING ubiquitin ligase complexes (CRL4B), is frequently overexpressed in cancer and represses tumor suppressors through diverse epigenetic mechanisms. However, the role and the underlying mechanisms of CUL4B in regulating drug resistance remain unknown. Here, we showed that CUL4B promotes TAM resistance in breast cancer cells through a miR-32-5p/ER-α36 axis. We found that upregulation of CUL4B correlated with decreased TAM sensitivity of breast cancer cells, and knockdown of CUL4B or expression of a dominant-negative CUL4B mutant restored the response to TAM in TAM-resistant MCF7-TAMR and T47D-TAMR cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that CUL4B renders breast cancer cells TAM-resistant by upregulating ER-α36 expression, which was mediated by downregulation of miR-32-5p. We further showed that CRL4B epigenetically represses the transcription of miR-32-5p by catalyzing monoubiquitination at H2AK119 and coordinating with PRC2 and HDAC complexes to promote trimethylation at H3K27 at the promoter of miR-32-5p. Pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of CRL4B/PRC2/HDAC complexes significantly increased TAM sensitivity in breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findings thus establish a critical role for the CUL4B-miR-32-5p-ER-α36 axis in the regulation of TAM resistance and have important therapeutic implications for combined application of TAM and the inhibitors of CRL4B/PRC2/HDAC complex in breast cancer treatment. © 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

       "  'abstract': 'Evolutionary shifts among radiate, disciform and discoid flowerheads have occurred repeatedly in a number of major lineages across the Asteraceae phylogeny; such transitions may also appear within evolutionarily young groups. Although several studies have demonstrated that CYC2 genes partake in regulating floral morphogenesis in Asteraceae, the evolution of capitulum forms within a recently diverging lineage has remained poorly understood. Here, we study the molecular regulation of the shift from a radiate to a disciform capitulum within the Chrysanthemum group. This is a recently radiating group mainly comprising two genera, Chrysanthemum and Ajania, that are phylogenetically intermingled but distinct in flowerhead morphology: Chrysanthemum\\xa0spp. with radiate capitula and Ajania\\xa0spp. with disciform capitula. We found that the morphogenesis of zygomorphy in the marginal floret in Ajania was disrupted soon after floral primordium emergence; CYC2g, one of the CYC2 copies that was expressed prominently in the ray floret of Chrysanthemum was not expressed in flowerheads of Ajania. Weakening the expression of ClCYC2g in Chrysanthemum lavandulifolium led to the gradual transition of a ray flower toward the disc-like form. Molecular evolutionary analyses indicated that the disciform capitulum might have evolved only once, approximately 8\\xa0Mya, arising from dysfunction of the CYC2g orthologs. A 20-nt deletion, including a putative TATA-box of the Ajania-type CYC2g promoter, appeared to inhibit the expression of the gene. Considering the divergent habitats of Chrysanthemum and Ajania, we propose that the shift from radiate to disciform capitulum must have been related to changes in pollination strategies under selective pressure.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The p53 family member p63 exists as two major protein variants (TAp63 and ΔNp63) with distinct expression patterns and functional properties. Whilst downstream target genes of p63 have been studied intensively, how p63 variants are themselves controlled has been relatively neglected. Here, we review advances in understanding ΔNp63 and TAp63 regulation, highlighting their distinct pathways. TAp63 has roles in senescence and metabolism, and in germ cell genome maintenance, where it is activated post-transcriptionally by phosphorylation cascades after DNA damage. The function and regulation of TAp63 in mesenchymal and haematopoietic cells is less clear but may involve epigenetic control through DNA methylation. ΔNp63 functions to maintain stem/progenitor cells in various epithelia and is overexpressed in squamous and certain other cancers. ΔNp63 is transcriptionally regulated through multiple enhancers in concert with chromatin modifying proteins. Many signalling pathways including growth factors, morphogens, inflammation, and the extracellular matrix influence ΔNp63 levels, with inconsistent results reported. There is also evidence for reciprocal regulation, including ΔNp63 activating its own transcription. ΔNp63 is downregulated during cell differentiation through transcriptional regulation, while post-transcriptional events cause proteasomal degradation. Throughout the review, we identify knowledge gaps and highlight discordances, providing potential explanations including cell-context and cell-matrix interactions. Identifying individual p63 variants has roles in differential diagnosis and prognosis, and understanding their regulation suggests clinically approved agents for targeting p63 that may be useful combination therapies for selected cancer patients. © 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Then, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) isolated from mice were pretreated with FP7 followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and FP7 specifically suppressed LPS-induced inflammatory responses in BMDMs via Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway, with no effect on other TLRs-mediated inflammations. Finally, we injected mice with LPS and D-galactosamine to induce septic shock, followed by the treatment of FP7, and FP7 significantly increased survival rate, improved lung necrosis, and inhibited the secretions of proinflammatory cytokines in the mice with septic shock. Therefore, our study suggested that FP7 had a protective role in septic shock and it might serve as a promising therapeutic candidate drug to treat septic shock.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abscission of plant organs is induced by developmental signals and diverse environmental stimuli and involves multiple regulatory networks, including biotic or abiotic stress-impaired auxin flux in the abscission zone (AZ). Depletion of auxin activates AZ ethylene (ETH) production and triggers acceleration of abscission, a process that requires hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the interaction between these networks and the underlying mechanisms that control abscission are poorly understood. Here, we found that expression of tonoplast intrinsic proteins, which belong to the aquaporin (AQP) family in the AZ was important for tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) pedicel abscission. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and in situ hybridization revealed that SlTIP1;1 was most abundant and specifically present in the tomato pedicel AZ. SlTIP1;1 localized in the plasma membrane and tonoplast. Knockout of SlTIP1;1 resulted in delayed abscission, whereas overexpression of SlTIP1;1 accelerated abscission. Further analysis indicated that SlTIP1;1 mediated abscission via gating of cytoplasmic H2O2 concentrations and osmotic water permeability (Pf). Elevated cytoplasmic levels of H2O2 caused a suppressed auxin signal in the early abscission stage and enhanced ETH production during abscission. Furthermore, we found that increasing Pf was required to enhance the turgor pressure to supply the break force for AZ cell separation. Moreover, we observed that SlERF52 bound directly to the SlTIP1;1 promoter to regulate its expression, demonstrating a positive loop in which cytoplasmic H2O2 activates ETH production, which activates SlERF52. This, in turn, induces SlTIP1;1, which leads to elevated cytoplasmic H2O2 and water influx.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'GhMYB4 acts as a negative regulator in lignin biosynthesis, which results in alteration of cell wall integrity and activation of cotton defense response. Verticillium wilt of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) caused by the soil-borne fungus Verticillium dahliae (V. dahliae) represents one of the most important constraints of cotton production worldwide. Mining of the genes involved in disease resistance and illuminating the molecular mechanisms that underlie this resistance is of great importance in cotton breeding programs. Defense-induced lignification in plants is necessary for innate immunity, and there are reports of a correlation between increased lignification and disease resistance. In this study, we present an example in cotton whereby plants with reduced lignin content also exhibit enhanced disease resistance. We identified a negative regulator of lignin synthesis, in cotton encoded in GhMYB4. Overexpression of GhMYB4 in cotton and Arabidopsis enhanced resistance to V. dahliae\\xa0 with reduced lignin deposition. Moreover, GhMYB4 could bind the promoters of several genes involved in lignin synthesis, such as GhC4H-1, GhC4H-2, Gh4CL-4, and GhCAD-3, and impair their expression. The reduction of lignin content in GhMYB4-overexpressing cotton led to alterations of cell wall integrity (CWI) and released more oligogalacturonides (OGs) which may act as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to stimulate plant defense responses. In support of this hypothesis, exogenous application with polygalacturonic acid (PGA) in cotton activated biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA) and JA-mediated defense against V. dahliae, similar to that described for cotton plants overexpressing GhMYB4. This study provides a new candidate gene for cotton disease-resistant breeding and an increased understanding of the relationship between lignin synthesis, OG release, and plant immunity.',\n",

Tumor contouring was performed manually by four different operators and with a semi-automatic edge-based segmentation (SAEB) algorithm. Three SUVmax fixed thresholds (20, 30, 40%) were applied. Fifty-one RFs were extracted applying two different intensity rescale factors for gray-level discretization: one absolute (AR60 = SUV from 0 to 60) and one relative (RR = min-max of the VOI SUV). Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was calculated to quantify segmentation agreement between different segmentation methods. The impact of segmentation and discretization on RFs was assessed by intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and the coefficient of variance (COVL). The RFs' correlation with volume and SUVmax was analyzed by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficients.\\nRESULTS\\nDSC mean value was 0.75 ± 0.11 (0.45-0.92) between SAEB and operators and 0.78 ± 0.09 (0.36-0.97), among the four manual segmentations. The study showed high robustness (ICC >\\u20090.9): (a) in 64.7% of RFs for segmentation methods using AR60, improved by applying SUVmax threshold of 40% (86.5%); (b) in 50.9% of RFs for different SUVmax thresholds using AR60; and (c) in 37% of RFs for discretization settings using different segmentation methods. Several RFs were not correlated with volume and SUVmax.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nRFs robustness to manual segmentation resulted higher in NET 68Ga-DOTA-TOC images compared to 18F-FDG PET/CT images. Forty percent SUVmax thresholds yield superior RFs stability among operators, however leading to a possible loss of biological information. SAEB segmentation appears to be an optimal alternative to manual segmentation, but further validations are needed. Finally, discretization settings highly impacted on RFs robustness and should always be stated.\",\n",

In this study, we elucidated the effects of AGEs on hSR-BI/CLA-1 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). HSR-BI/CLA-1 expression was examined by real-time PCR, western blot analysis, and reporter gene assay in HUVECs incubated with AGEs. eNOS activity was assessed by detecting the phosphorylation (Ser 1179) of eNOS. Our results showed that AGEs decreased the endogenous expression of hSR-BI/CLA-1. AGEs also inhibited the activity of the hSR-BI/CLA-1 promoter and its mRNA expression via receptor RAGE. We identified the binding site for Smad1 on the hSR-BI/CLA-1 promoter: Smad1 bound to its promoter. AGE treatment stimulated the transcriptional activity of Smad1, and mutation of the Smad1 binding site inhibited the effect of AGEs on the hSR-BI/CLA-1 promoter.

       "  'abstract': 'RcsB is a transcriptional regulator that controls expression of numerous genes in enteric bacteria. RcsB accomplishes this role alone or in combination with auxiliary transcriptional factors independently or dependently of phosphorylation. To understand the mechanisms by which RcsB regulates such large number of genes, we performed structural studies as well as in vitro and in vivo functional studies with different RcsB variants. Our structural data reveal that RcsB binds promoters of target genes such as rprA and flhDC in a dimeric active conformation. In this state, the RcsB homodimer docks the DNA-binding domains into the major groove of the DNA, facilitating an initial weak read-out of the target sequence. Interestingly, comparative structural analyses also show that DNA binding may stabilize an active conformation in unphosphorylated RcsB. Furthermore, RNAseq performed in strains expressing wild-type or several RcsB variants provided new insights into the contribution of phosphorylation to gene regulation and assign a potential role of RcsB in controlling iron metabolism. Finally, we delimited the RcsB box for homodimeric active binding to DNA as the sequence TN(G/A)GAN4TC(T/C)NA. This RcsB box was found in promoter, intergenic and intragenic regions, facilitating both increased or decreased gene transcription.',\n",

Here, we describe an active member of the Tc1/mariner transposon superfamily, named ZB, which invaded the zebrafish genome very recently. ZB exhibits high activity in vertebrate cells, in the range of those of the widely used transposons piggyBac (PB), Sleeping Beauty (SB) and Tol2. ZB has a similar structural organization and target site sequence preference to SB, but a different integration profile with respect to genome-wide preference among mammalian functional annotation features. Namely, ZB displays a preference for integration into transcriptional regulatory regions of genes. Accordingly, we demonstrate the utility of ZB for enhancer trapping in zebrafish embryos and in the mouse germline.

       "  'abstract': 'Misregulation of BCL2 expression has been observed with many diseases and is associated with cellular exposure to reactive oxygen species. A region upstream of the P1 promoter in the human BCL2 gene plays a major role in regulating transcription. This G/C-rich region is highly polymorphic and capable of forming G-quadruplex structures. Herein we report that an oxidative event simulated with an 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (oxoG) substitution within a long G-tract results in a reduction of structural polymorphism. Surprisingly, oxoG within a 25-nt construct boosts thermal stability of the resulting G-quadruplex. This is achieved by distinct hydrogen bonding properties of oxoG, which facilitate formation of an antiparallel basket-type G-quadruplex with a three G-quartet core and a G·oxoG·C base triad. While oxoG has previously been considered detrimental for G-quadruplex formation, its stabilizing effect within a promoter described in this study suggests a potential novel regulatory role of oxidative stress in general and specifically in BCL2 gene transcription.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Epilepsy is a neurological condition associated to significant brain damage produced by status epilepticus (SE) including neurodegeneration, gliosis and ectopic neurogenesis. Reduction of these processes constitutes a useful strategy to improve recovery and ameliorate negative outcomes after an initial insult.

For this study, we used 4-5\\xa0months old male transgenic C57BL/6\\xa0J and FVB/NJ mice expressing near physiological levels of a constitutively active form of the kinase controlled by its endogenous promoter.

This neuroprotective effect is not exclusively through M-current activation but is also directly linked to decreased apoptosis levels assessed by TUNEL assays and quantification of Bim and Bcl-xL by western blot of hippocampal protein extracts. Our results demonstrate that this newly described antiapoptotic role of SGK1.1 activation acts synergistically with the regulation of cellular excitability, resulting in a significant reduction of SE-induced brain damage in areas relevant to epileptogenesis.',\n",

Accumulating evidence suggests that α-syn oligomers are particularly neurotoxic. Transgenic (tg) mice overexpressing wild-type human α-syn under the Thy-1 promoter (L61) reproduce many Parkinson's disease features, but the pathogenetic relevance of α-syn oligomers in this mouse model has not been studied in detail. Here, we report an age progressive increase of α-syn oligomers in the brain of L61 tg mice. Interestingly, more profound motor symptoms were observed in animals with higher levels of membrane-bound oligomers. As this tg model is X-linked, we also performed subset analyses, indicating that both sexes display a similar age-related increase in α-syn oligomers. However, compared with females, males featured increased brain levels of oligomers from an earlier age, in addition to a more severe behavioral phenotype with hyperactivity and thigmotaxis in the open field test.

In order to account for possible spin polarization effects, the FDE contribution is extended to the unrestricted case. We assess the convergence obtained with the implementation at the example of a stretched lithium dimer with significant multi-reference character.

The differential expression analysis was performed using \"limma\" and \"edgeR\". Target mRNAs of miRNAs were predicted using FunRich 3.1.3, miRNAtap and multiMiR. The candidate mRNAs and exosomal miRNAs were obtained by intersecting two groups of differentially expressed miRNAs and intersection of the differential expressed mRNAs and the target mRNAs, respectively. Key mRNAs and exosomal miRNAs were identified by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis, and used to construct the exosomal miRNA-mRNA network. The network verified was by receiver operating characteristic curve, GEPIA and LinkedOmics. Functional enrichment analysis was also performed for studied miRNAs and mRNAs.\\nRESULTS\\nA total of 6568 differentially expressed mRNAs and 531 differentially expressed miRNAs from TCGA data, and 166 differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs in GSE39833 dataset were identified. Next, 16 key mRNAs and five key exosomal miRNAs were identified from the 5284 candidate mRNAs and 61 candidate exosomal miRNAs, respectively. The exosomal miRNA-mRNA network with high connectivity contained 13 hub mRNAs (CBFB, CDH3, ETV4, FOXQ1, FUT1, GCNT2, GRIN2D, KIAA1549, KRT80, LZTS1, SLC39A10, SPTBN2, and ZSWIM4) and five hub exosomal miRNAs (hsa-miR-126, hsa-miR-139, hsa-miR-141, hsa-miR-29c, and hsa-miR-423). The functional annotation revealed that these hub mRNAs were mainly involved in the regulation of B cell receptor signaling pathway and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis related pathways. All hub mRNAs and hub exosomal miRNAs exhibited high diagnosis value for CRC. Furthermore, the association of the hub mRNAs with overall survival, stages, and MSI phenotype of CRC revealed their important roles in CRC progression.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThis study constructed an exosomal miRNA-mRNA network which may play crucial roles in the carcinogenesis and progression of CRC, thus providing potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for CRC.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Despite long-term practical experience with waste incineration plants, their operation under the conditions for which they were designed pose challenges, mainly due to the heterogeneous composition of the waste feed. Within the framework of the present paper, the operation of 6 waste incineration plants (five grate and one fluidized bed incinerator) have been analysed in terms of hourly steam production, waste throughput, auxiliary fuel consumption and air surplus over one year. The results reveal that the operation of the majority of the plants was negatively influenced during times of waste delivery. Reductions in steam production and waste throughput of up to 3% were observed for these times in comparison to periods without any delivery of waste. Furthermore, an increase in air surplus and auxiliary fuels consumption (up to a factor of 2) was noticed, both resulting in lower environmental performance. The results further indicate that incineration plants receiving their waste via trucks are more prone to impairments of performance than plants supplied via train delivery. This observation might be explained by the fact that train delivery requires a transfer of the waste from truck to train, which is typically associated with a mixing of the waste. Based on the observed impairment of the operation during waste delivery times, the related economic loss for plant operators is estimated to be several 100,000 Euros per year. Hence, in order to improve the performance of waste incineration plants, a better mixing of the waste, in particular during times of waste delivery, is recommended.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Sulforaphane-cisplatin combination inhibits the stemness and metastatic potential of TNBCs via down regulation of sirtuins-mediated EMT signaling axis.',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND\\nSulforaphane (SFN) is a naturally occurring organosulfur compound found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, brussels sprouts and cabbage. SFN is known for its multiple therapeutic properties, such as HDAC inhibitory, chemo preventive and anti-cancer effects. Cisplatin (CIS) has limited effect against metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Additionally, CIS impose severe side effects to normal cells, and later TNBC cells develops resistance. Studies suggest that the overexpression of sirtuins (SIRTs) promotes CIS resistance and metastasis by activating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway in TNBC.\\nPURPOSE\\nIn view of the above information, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of SFN, in combination with CIS against TNBC metastasis and CIS resistance.\\nMETHODS\\nThe anti-cancerous effect of SFN-CIS combination on human TNBC cell lines was demonstrated by utilizing MTT assay and, apoptosis and cell cycle assay followed by FACS analysis. The synergistic effect of SFN-CIS combination on the experimental metastasis was demonstrated by utilizing migration, invasion, chemotaxis, mammosphere and colony formation assay on human TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. The role of SIRTs-mediated EMT signaling axis in the metastasis and chemoresistance was investigated by western blotting technique as well as sirtuin activity tests. This was further validated by using Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis.\\nRESULTS\\nWe found that SFN-CIS combination synergistically inhibits cellular growth of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. More importantly, SFN was found to protect normal kidney cells from CIS-induced toxicity. Further, SFN-CIS combination was found to synergistically inhibit metastatic-events via significantly altering EMT markers which was further associated with the suppression of SIRTs functions in TNBC cells. ChIP analysis validated that SFN-CIS combination suppresses EMT mechanism through altered chromatin modifications at E-cadherin promoter resulting in its re-expression.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe results of the current study suggests that CIS when supplemented with SFN, inhibits metastasis and stemness potential of TNBC cells by down regulating SIRTs-mediated EMT cascade. Overall this study affirms that, this novel combination could be a promising strategy against SIRT-mediated TNBC metastasis and CIS-resistance.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Aberrant DNA methylation in the BRCA1 promoter region causes epigenetic silencing of BRCA1 gene expression, which is critical for breast cancer development. However, how BRCA1 promoter methylation status alters histological features remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the possibility to predict BRCA1 promoter methylation status based on the morphological and immunohistochemical features of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs). The morphological features of 53 TNBCs were evaluated with hematoxylin-eosin staining, with immunohistochemical staining of BRCA1, androgen receptor, p53, cytokeratin 5/6, and epidermal growth factor receptor. BRCA1 promoter methylation status was used to distinguish BRCA1 promoter-methylated tumors (BPMTs) from BRCA1 promoter-unmethylated tumors (BPUTs) dependent on pathological characteristics. BPMTs comprised approximately 26% of the TNBCs. Immunohistochemical analysis found that BRCA1 protein expression was significantly lower in BPMT compared with BPUT (p\\u2009=\\u20090.016). Morphologically, BPMTs were associated with high mitotic index (p\\u2009=\\u20090.017), pushing margin (p\\u2009=\\u20090.017), a circumscribed growth pattern (p\\u2009=\\u20090.014), and a syncytial growth pattern (p\\u2009=\\u20090.034) compared with BPUTs. We then assessed the potential of predicting BRCA1 promoter methylation status by using published score systems based on these morphological characteristics. A receiver operating characteristic analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.80. This study found that BRCA1 promoter methylation status could be derived from morphological features and lower BRCA1 expression of TNBCs, which may help identify suitable cases for target treatment with PARP inhibitors.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) has a complex pathogenesis, making it a difficult disorder to treat. Identifying relevant signaling pathways in the brain may be useful for finding new pharmacological targets to treat AUD. The receptor tyrosine kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) activates the transcription factor STAT3 in response to ethanol in cell lines. Here, we show ALK activation and upregulation of known STAT3 target genes (Socs3, Gfap and Tnfrsf1a) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and ventral hippocampus (HPC) of mice after 4\\u2009days of binge-like ethanol drinking. Mice treated with the STAT3 inhibitor stattic drank less ethanol than vehicle-treated mice, demonstrating the behavioral importance of STAT3. To identify novel ethanol-induced target genes downstream of the ALK and STAT3 pathway, we analyzed the NIH LINCS L1000 database for gene signature overlap between ALK inhibitor (alectinib and NVP-TAE684) and STAT3 inhibitor (niclosamide) treatments on cell lines. These genes were then compared with differentially expressed genes in the PFC of mice after binge-like drinking. We found 95 unique gene candidates, out of which 57 had STAT3 binding motifs in their promoters. We further showed by qPCR that expression of the putative STAT3 genes Nr1h2, Smarcc1, Smarca4 and Gpnmb were increased in either the PFC or HPC after binge-like drinking. Together, these results indicate activation of the ALK-STAT3 signaling pathway in the brain after binge-like ethanol consumption, identify putative novel ethanol-responsive STAT3 target genes, and suggest that STAT3 inhibition may be a potential method to reduce binge drinking in humans.',\n",

To cope with cold stress, plants must be able to perceive a cold signal and regulate the expression of cold-regulated (COR) genes. In our recent study, we showed that Arabidopsis HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENE 15 (HOS15) acts as a substrate receptor for CULLIN4-based ubiquitin E3 ligase complex to promote cold-induced histone deacetylase 2\\xa0C (HD2C) degradation that allows the activation of COR genes. Additionally, we found that POWERDRESS (PWR), a HOS15-interacting protein, is required for the association of HOS15 with COR gene chromatin and HD2C degradation. The HOS15/PWR complex interacts with and recruits CBF transcription factors to the promoters of COR genes. Collectively, our previous findings suggest that HOS15 and PWR function as positive regulators for the expression of COR genes, and promote cold tolerance.

       "  'abstract': 'During the secondary transition of rodent pancreatic development, mainly between E12.5 and E15.5 in mice, exocrine and endocrine populations differentiate from pancreatic progenitors. Here we describe an experimental system for its study in vitro. First, we show that spheres derived from dissociated E12.5 mouse pancreases differentiate within 7\\xa0days into most pancreatic exocrine and endocrine cell types, including beta cells. The proportion and spatial repartition of the different endocrine populations mirror those observed during normal development. Thus, dissociation and culture do not impair the developmental events affecting pancreatic progenitors during the secondary transition. Moreover, dissociated cells from mouse E12.5 pancreas were transduced with ecotropic MLV-based retroviral vectors or, though less efficiently, with a mixture of ALV(A)-based retroviral vectors and gesicles containing the TVA (Tumor Virus A) receptor. As an additional improvement, we also created a transgenic mouse line expressing TVA under the control of the 4.5 kB pdx1 promoter (pdx1-TVA). We demonstrate that pancreatic progenitors from dissociated pdx1-TVA pancreas can be specifically transduced by ALV(A)-based retroviral vectors. Using this model, we expressed an activated mutant of the YAP transcriptional co-activator in pancreatic progenitors. These experiments indicate that deregulated YAP activity reduces endocrine and exocrine differentiation in the resulting spheres, confirming and extending previously published data.

In this study, PCR array screened a significant increase of miR-200c in BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells after ISL treatment, and ISH exerted that miR-200c was expressed at a low level in breast cancer tissue of patients. We also found that ISL could up-regulate miR-200c, resulting in the inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Meanwhile, ISL could inhibit metastasis and tumor growth in nude mice models through the increase of miR-200c. Further study displayed that ISL decreased c-Jun expression through the increase of miR-200c.

However, it seems that a single focus measure operator is not capable of computing accurate focus values for the images of diverse types of object shapes. Furthermore, most of the SFF methods try to improve the depth map without considering any additional structural or prior information. Consequently, the extracted shape of the object might lack important details. In this work, we address these problems and suggest a method in which depth hypotheses are combined for a more accurate 3D shape through 3D weighted least squares. First, depth hypotheses are obtained by applying a number of focus operators. Then, structural prior or guidance volume is extracted from the focus measure volumes. Finally, a 3D weighted least squares optimization technique is applied to the depth hypothesis volume, where weights are computed from the guidance volume. Thus, by inducing structural prior, an improved resultant depth map is obtained. The proposed method was tested using various image sequences of synthetic and microscopic real objects.

However, for cancer stem cell (CSC) studies, they exhibit notable limitations on simulating native environment, which depreciate their translatability for clinical development purposes. In this study, different three-dimensional (3D) printing platforms were used to establish novel 3D cell cultures enriched in CSCs from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and cell lines. Rigid scaffolds with an elevated compressive modulus and uniform pores and channels were produced using different filaments. Hydrogel-based scaffolds were printed with a more irregular distribution of pores and a lower compressive modulus. As a 3D model of reference, suspension spheroid cultures were established. Therein, cancer cell lines exhibited enhanced proliferation profiles on rigid scaffolds compared to the same cells grown on either hydrogel scaffolds or tumor spheres. Meanwhile, primary cancer cells grew considerably better on hydrogel scaffolds or in tumor sphere culture, compared to cells grown on rigid scaffolds. Gene expression analysis confirmed that tumor spheres and cells seeded on hydrogel scaffolds significantly overexpress most of stemness and invasion promoters tested compared to control cells grown in 2D culture. A different phenomenon was observed within cells growing on the rigid scaffolds, where fewer significant variations in gene expression were detected. Our findings provide strong evidence for the advantageous usage of 3D printed models, especially those which use GelMA-PEGDA hydrogels as the primary scaffold material, for studying lung CSCs. The results demonstrated that the 3D printed scaffolds were better to mimic tumor complexity and regulate cancer cell behavior than in vivo 2D culture models.',\n",

An externalized active fixation lead (AFL) for AVB3 has already been implanted by 50% of the operators. 80 (86%) have already observed a dislocation of the TPL, a cardiac perforation already occurred in 57 (61%), a groin hematoma in 35 (38%), and this technique was proscribed for 4% of the operators.\\nCONCLUSION\\nOur survey shows important disparities in terms of management of AVB3 among the different centers. An externalized AFL with a reusable generator was used by half of the centers.',\n",

However, whether metformin inhibits inflammation and cell death in UVB-induced acute skin damage is unclear.\\nOBJECTIVE\\nTo evaluate the anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects of metformin in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, its potential mechanism has been explored.\\nMETHODS\\nTranscriptome sequencing and multiplex cytokines analysis were used to evaluate the validity of in vitro UVB-induced acute damage keratinocyte model and anti-inflammatory effects of metformin. We also determined the expression and nuclear translocation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPβ), an important transcriptional factor of Interleukin-1beta (IL-1β). Cell viability and cell death of keratinocytes were evaluated upon UVB irradiation in the presence or absence of metformin. 0.6% metformin cream was applied on UVB-irradiated mice to explore its pharmacological effects in vivo.\\nRESULTS\\nTranscriptional landscape of 50 mJ/cm2 UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells is typical of UVB-induced acute damage keratinocyte model in vitro. Metformin alleviated transcription and secretion of IL-1β, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, and Fibroblast Growth Factor 2, expression and nuclear translocation of C/EBPβ in this model. Metformin also protected keratinocytes from cell death caused by UVB-induced cellular secretions, which contributed to its cytoprotective effects.

       "  'abstract': 'This study was designed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of Alpinia officinarum Hance extract (AOE) and identify its main active ingredients. AOE was obtained using a 95% ethanol extraction method. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used to induce an inflammatory response in RAW264.7 cells. The results showed that AOE exerts anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of prostaglandin E2 secretion and cyclooxygenase -2 (COX-2) production. We further analyzed the components of AOE using high-performance liquid chromatography and found that AOE is comprised of several bioactive flavonoids including quercetin (Q), kaempferol (K), galangin (G), and curcumin (C). These four flavonoids effectively inhibited nitric oxide (NO), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α production. Moreover, they reduced COX-2 and inducible NO synthase expressions via regulation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathways. Furthermore, we compared and contrasted the anti-inflammatory effects and mechanisms of these four flavonoids at the same dose in the LPS-induced cell inflammation model. The results showed that C is the most effective inhibitor of LPS-induced NO production. However, only Q and K effectively attenuated LPS-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 elevations. In conclusion, AOE and its major bioactive compounds exert anti-inflammatory effects on LPS-induced inflammation. As A. officinarum Hance is much cheaper than any of its four flavonoids, especially G, we suggest using AOE as an anti-inflammatory agent.',\n",

The present study sought to determine roles of NRDC in the liver on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. We established liver-specific NRDC deficient mice by use of NRD1 floxed mice and albumin promoter-Cre recombinase (Cre) transgenic mice, and found that their serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were significantly lower than those in control littermate mice. In the liver, LDL receptor (LDLR) mRNA expression was significantly upregulated, while inducible degrader of LDLR (IDOL) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) mRNA expression was significantly downregulated, in liver-specific NRDC deficient mice. Hepatic cell-surface LDLR expression levels were significantly elevated and serum pro-protein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) levels were significantly reduced in mice with hepatic NRDC deficiency. In cultured hepatocytes, NRDC deficiency significantly reduced secreted PCSK9 and increased cell-surface LDLR expression. On the other hand, NRDC overexpression in cultured hepatocytes significantly increased secreted PCSK9 and lowered cell-surface LDLR expression. Thus, NRDC in murine hepatocytes appears to play key roles in cholesterol homeostasis, although the precise molecular mechanisms remain to be determined.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The efficacy of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) has been documented, but the optimization of this system, as well as CRISPR/Cas9-mediated multiplex genome editing, has not been explored in this species. Herein, we identified four VvU3 and VvU6 promoters and two ubiquitin (UBQ) promoters in grapevine and demonstrated that the use of the identified VvU3/U6 and UBQ2 promoters could significantly increase the editing efficiency in grape by improving the expression of sgRNA and Cas9, respectively. Furthermore, we conducted multiplex genome editing using the optimized CRISPR/Cas9 vector that contained the conventional multiple sgRNA expression cassettes or the polycistronic tRNA-sgRNA cassette (PTG) by targeting the sugar-related tonoplastic monosaccharide transporter (TMT) family members TMT1 and TMT2, and the overall editing efficiencies were higher than 10%. The simultaneous editing of TMT1 and TMT2 resulted in reduced sugar levels, which indicated the role of these two genes in sugar accumulation in grapes. Moreover, the activities of the VvU3, VvU6, and UBQ2 promoters in tobacco genome editing were demonstrated by editing the phytoene desaturase (PDS) gene in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Our study provides materials for the optimization of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. To our knowledge, our simultaneous editing of the grape TMT family genes TMT1 and TMT2 constitutes the first example of multiplex genome editing in grape. The multiplex editing systems described in this manuscript expand the toolbox of grape genome editing, which would facilitate basic research and molecular breeding in grapevine.',\n",

Here, we use a high-density linkage map to dissect large-scale flavonoid metabolic traits measured in different tissues (young leaf, old leaf, mature pericarp, and mature pulp) of an F1 pseudo-testcross citrus population. We detected 80 flavonoids in this population and identified 138 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for 57 flavonoids in these four tissues. Based on transcriptional profiling and functional annotation, twenty-one candidate genes were identified, and one gene encoding flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H) was functionally verified to result in naturally occurring variation in dihydrokaempferol content through genetic variations in its promoter and coding regions.

       "  'abstract': \"This study aims to understand the impacts of Pokémon GO, a popular location-based augmented reality (AR) mobile gaming app, on route and mode choices. Pokémon GO leverages AR to introduce virtual objects at fixed and dynamic locations that translate through the app interface to incentives in the real world that potentially influence users' route and mode choices. Its gaming nature and social components can possibly enhance long-term user engagement through applying the characteristics of game elements and providing opportunities for competition, collaboration, companionship, and social reinforcement. An online survey is conducted to collect the self-reported behavior of a group of Pokémon GO users to explore its impacts on the following aspects of travel behavior: (1) the frequency of changing the route to interact with virtual objects; (2) the likelihood of carpooling more instead of driving alone for more in-app collaboration; and (3) the likelihood of shifting mode from drive alone to public transit, walking, and cycling if provided with additional incentives. The ordered survey responses including frequency and likelihood are analyzed using random parameters ordered probit models to account for the unobserved heterogeneity across users and identify subpopulations of travelers who are more susceptible to the influence of Pokémon GO. The modeling results identify four types of variables (attitude and perceptions related to Pokémon GO, app engagement, play style, and sociodemographic characteristics) that affect users' travel behavior. The results illustrate that such apps with integrated AR, gamification, and social components can be used by policymakers to influence various aspects of travel behavior. The study findings and insights can provide valuable feedback to system operators for designing such apps to dynamically manage traffic in real-time and promote long-term sustainable mode shifts.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"BACKGROUND AND AIM\\nThe use of antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) in the poultry industry has raised concern because of their potential harm to human health. Emerging evidence suggests that probiotics are a safer substitute, although little research has explored this in Bangladesh. We recently isolated local bacterial strains with probiotic properties. We aimed to determine their impact on the growth, hematobiochemical parameters, and production costs of broiler chicks relative to that of a commercial probiotic (CP) and AGP.\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\nDay-old male broiler chicks (Cobb 500, n=63) were divided equally into three experimental groups (three replicates per group and seven chicks per replicate). First group was fed a basal diet supplemented with the AGP, ciprofloxacin (CTL group), second group was fed a basal diet supplemented with the CP, Protexin® (CP group), and the third group was fed a basal diet supplemented with our isolated bacterial strains (study probiotic [SP] group) for 36 days. Body weight was recorded daily, and relative growth rate (RGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and organ weights and carcass yields were calculated at the study's end. Blood obtained on day 36 was used to determine the number of red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cells (WBCs), hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, packed cell volume, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, as well as levels of serum glucose, total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides (TGs). Total production costs were estimated by summing the variable and fixed costs.\\nRESULTS\\nChicks in both the CP and SP groups experienced significant decreases in blood glucose levels and significant increases in BW, RGR, FCR, levels of RBC and WBC, Hb concentration, and packed cell volume compared with those in the CTL group (p<0.05 for all). Our data suggested a numerical reduction (p>0.05) in levels of total cholesterol, TGs, and HDL in the SP and CP groups when compared to the CTL group. In addition, both CP and SP treatments resulted in significant (p<0.05) gains in net profit compared with the treatment given to the CTL group.\\nCONCLUSION\\nAdministration of probiotics, either from a commercialized or local source, led to greater improvements in growth, hematological parameters, and net profits of broiler chicks when compared with that of an AGP. This suggests that they are suitable alternatives to the AGPs used in poultry feed and that our isolated strains, in particular, are an ideal option for farmers in Bangladesh.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Antimicrobial is an indispensable part of veterinary medicine used for the treatment and control of diseases as well as a growth promoter in livestock production. Frequent use of antimicrobials in veterinary practices may lead to the residue in animal originated products and creates some potential problems for human health. The presence of antimicrobial residues in animal originated foods may induce serious health problems such as allergic reaction, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and lead to carcinogenic and mutagenic effects in the human body. The misuse or abuse of antibiotics in human medicine is thought to be a principal cause of AMR but some antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and their resistant genes originating from animals are also responsible for developing AMR. However, the residual effect of antimicrobials in feed and food products of animal origin is undeniable. In developing countries, the community is unaware of this residual effect due to lack of proper information about antibiotic usage, AMR surveillance, and residue monitoring system. It is imperative to reveal the current situation of antimicrobial use in livestock production and its impacts on public health. Moreover, the safety levels of animal feeds and food products of animal origin must be strictly monitored and public awareness should be developed against the indiscriminate use of antimicrobial in animal production. Therefore, the current review summarizes the literature on antimicrobial use in livestock production and its hazardous residual impacts on the human body in developing countries.',\n",

Although miR-34a and palmitoyl membrane palmitoylated protein (MPP2) are reportedly involved in various cell processes, their precise roles in liver cancer are still unclear.\\nAIM\\nTo investigate the expression of micro RNA 34a (miR-34a), methylation of the miR-34a promoter and the expression of MPP2 in liver cancer cells and their related mechanisms.\\nMETHODS\\nTogether, 78 cases of liver cancer tissues and 78 cases of adjacent tissues were collected. The methylation degree of miR-34a promoter in liver cancer/ paracancerous tissue and liver cancer cells/normal liver cells, and the expression levels of miR-34a and MPP2 in the above samples were detected. Demethylation of liver cancer cells or transfection of liver cancer cells with miR-34a mimetic was performed. The MPP2 overexpression vector was used to transfect liver cancer cells, and the changes in proliferation, invasion, apoptosis, migration, and other biological functions of liver cancer cells after the above interventions were observed. Double luciferase reporter genes were used to detect the targeting relationship between miR-34a and MPP2.\\nRESULTS\\nClinical samples showed that the expression levels of miR-34a and MPP2 in liver cancer tissues were lower than those in the normal tissues. The methylation degree of miR-34a promoter region in liver cancer cells was higher than that in normal liver cells. After miR-34a demethylation/mimetic transfection/MPP2 overexpression, the apoptosis of liver cancer cells was increased; the proliferation, invasion and migration capabilities were decreased; the expression levels of caspase 3, caspase 9, E-cadherin, and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein were increased; and the expression levels of Bcl-2, N-cadherin, and β-catenin were decreased. Double luciferase reporter genes confirmed that MPP2 is targeted by miR-34a. Rescue experiments showed that small interfering MPP2 could counteract the promoting effect of miR-34a demethylation on apoptosis and the inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, invasion, and migration.\\nCONCLUSION\\nmiR-34a demethylation upregulates the expression level of MPP2 in liver cancer cells and promotes the apoptosis of liver cancer cells. miR-34a demethylation is a potential method for liver cancer treatment.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"BACKGROUND\\nTo perform successful coil embolization of cerebral aneurysms, it is crucial to make an appropriately shaped microcatheter tip for an aneurysm and its parent artery. So far, we manually shaped a mandrel by referencing two-dimensional (2D) images of a rotation digital subtraction angiography (DSA) on a computer screen. However, this technique requires a lot of experience, and often involves trial and error. Recently, there have been increasing reports of manual mandrel shaping using a full-scale three-dimensional (3D) model of an aneurysm and its parent artery output by various types of 3D printer. We have further developed this method by producing a hollow model of an aneurysm and its parent artery with a stereolithography 3D printer and inserting a mandrel inside the model to fit and stabilize a microcatheter tip.\\nMETHODS\\nBased on digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) data obtained by rotational DSA, 3D images of an aneurysm and its parent artery were created and converted into standard triangulated language (STL) data. A hollow model was produced by extruding the STL data outward in the normal direction, and then a hole was made at the tip of the aneurysm using these STL data. We output these STL data to a stereolithography 3D printer. After cleaning and sterilizing the model, the mandrel was inserted in the direction of the parent artery through the hole made in the tip of the aneurysm and pushed in, creating the ideal mandrel shape. Twelve cases (14 aneurysms) were included in this study. A microcatheter tip was shaped by this method for patients who were scheduled to undergo coil embolization for an unruptured aneurysm.\\nRESULTS\\nIn 13 of the 14 aneurysms, the microcatheter was easily guided into the aneurysms in one or two trials, the position of the microcatheter tip in the aneurysm was appropriate, and the stability during coil embolization was high.\\nCONCLUSION\\nOur method differs from the conventional one in that a hollow model made of resin is produced with a stereolithography 3D printer and that the mandrel is shaped by inserting it retrogradely into the hollow model. Using our new method, it will be possible to shape the tip of a microcatheter suitable for safe and stable coil embolization without relying on an operator's experience.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'COVID-19 is a global pandemic that aroused the interest of scientists to prevent it and design a drug for it. Nowadays, presenting intelligent biological data analysis tools at a low cost is important to analyze the biological structure of COVID-19. The global alignment algorithm is one of the important bioinformatics tools that measure the most accurate similarity between a pair of biological sequences. The huge time consumption of the standard global alignment algorithm is its main limitation especially for sequences with huge lengths. This work proposed a fast global alignment tool (G-Aligner) based on meta-heuristic algorithms that estimate similarity measurements near the exact ones at a reasonable time with low cost. The huge length of sequences leads G-Aligner based on standard Sine-Cosine optimization algorithm (SCA) to trap in local minima. Therefore, an improved version of SCA was presented in this work that is based on integration with PSO. Besides, mutation and opposition operators are applied to enhance the exploration capability and avoiding trapping in local minima. The performance of the improved SCA algorithm (SP-MO) was evaluated on a set of IEEE CEC functions. Besides, G-Aligner based on the SP-MO algorithm was tested to measure the similarity of real biological sequence. It was used also to measure the similarity of the COVID-19 virus with the other 13 viruses to validate its performance. The tests concluded that the SP-MO algorithm has superiority over the relevant studies in the literature and produce the highest average similarity measurements 75% of the exact one.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background: Several neuroimaging studies report structural alterations of the trigeminal nerve in trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Less attention has been paid to structural brain changes occurring in TN, even though such changes can influence the development and response to treatment of other headache and chronic pain conditions. The purpose of this study was to apply a novel neuroimaging technique-texture analysis-to identify structural brain differences between classical TN patients and healthy subjects. Methods: We prospectively recruited 14 medically refractory classical TN patients and 20 healthy subjects. 3-Tesla T1-weighted brain MRI scans were acquired in all participants. Three texture features (autocorrelation, contrast, energy) were calculated within four a priori brain regions of interest (anterior cingulate, insula, thalamus, brainstem). Voxel-wise analysis was used to identify clusters of texture difference between TN patients and healthy subjects within regions of interest (p < 0.001, cluster size >20 voxels). Median raw texture values within clusters were also compared between groups, and further used to differentiate TN patients from healthy subjects (receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis). Median raw texture values were correlated with pain severity (visual analog scale, 1-100) and illness duration. Results: Several clusters of texture difference were observed between TN patients and healthy subjects: right-sided TN patients showed reduced autocorrelation in the left brainstem, increased contrast in the left brainstem and right anterior insula, and reduced energy in right and left anterior cingulate, right midbrain, and left brainstem. Within-cluster median raw texture values also differed between TN patients and healthy subjects: TN patients could be segregated from healthy subjects using brainstem autocorrelation (p = 0.0040, AUC = 0.84, sensitivity = 89%, specificity = 70%), anterior insula contrast (p = 0.0002, AUC = 0.92, sensitivity = 78%, specificity = 100%), and anterior cingulate energy (p = 0.0004, AUC = 0.92, sensitivity = 78%, specificity = 100%). Additionally, anterior insula contrast and duration of TN were inversely correlated (p = 0.030, Spearman r = -0.73). Conclusions: Texture analysis reveals distinct brain abnormalities in TN, which relate to clinical features such as duration of illness. These findings further implicate structural brain changes in the development and maintenance of TN.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is characterized by lung granulomas, inflammation and tissue destruction. Here we used within-subject peripheral blood gene expression over time to correlate with the within-subject lung metabolic activity, as measured by positron emission tomography (PET) to identify biological processes and pathways underlying overall resolution of lung inflammation. We used next-generation RNA sequencing and [18F]FDG PET-CT data, collected at diagnosis, week 4, and week 24, from 75 successfully cured PTB patients, with the [18F]FDG activity as a surrogate for lung inflammation. Our linear mixed-effects models required that for each individual the slope of the line of [18F]FDG data in the outcome and the slope of the peripheral blood transcript expression data correlate, i.e., the slopes of the outcome and explanatory variables had to be similar. Of 10,295 genes that changed as a function of time, we identified 639 genes whose expression profiles correlated with decreasing [18F]FDG uptake levels in the lungs. Gene enrichment over-representation analysis revealed that numerous biological processes were significantly enriched in the 639 genes, including several well known in TB transcriptomics such as platelet degranulation and response to interferon gamma, thus validating our novel approach. Others not previously associated with TB pathobiology included smooth muscle contraction, a set of pathways related to mitochondrial function and cell death, as well as a set of pathways connecting transcription, translation and vesicle formation. We observed up-regulation in genes associated with B cells, and down-regulation in genes associated with platelet activation. We found 254 transcription factor binding sites to be enriched among the 639 gene promoters. In conclusion, we demonstrated that of the 10,295 gene expression changes in peripheral blood, only a subset of 639 genes correlated with inflammation in the lungs, and the enriched pathways provide a description of the biology of resolution of lung inflammation as detectable in peripheral blood. Surprisingly, resolution of PTB inflammation is positively correlated with smooth muscle contraction and, extending our previous observation on mitochondrial genes, shows the presence of mitochondrial stress. We focused on pathway analysis which can enable therapeutic target discovery and potential modulation of the host response to TB.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Moderate curling generally causes upright leaf blades, which favors the establishment of ideal plant architecture and increases the photosynthetic efficiency of the population, both of which are desirable traits for super hybrid rice (Oryza sativa L.). In this study, we identified a novel curled-leaf mutant, curled flag leaf 2 (cfl2), which shows specific curling at the base of the flag leaf owing to abnormal epidermal development, caused by enlarged bulliform cells and increased number of papillae with the disordered distribution. Map-based cloning reveals that CFL2 encodes a cytochrome P450 protein and corresponds to the previously reported OsCYP96B4. CFL2 was expressed in all analyzed tissues with differential abundance and was downregulated in the clf1 mutant [a mutant harbors a mutation in the homeodomain leucine zipper IV (HD-ZIP IV) transcription factor Roc5]. Yeast one-hybrid and transient expression assays confirm that Roc5 could directly bind to the cis-element L1 box in the promoter of CFL2 before activating CFL2 expression. RNA sequencing reveals that genes associated with cellulose biosynthesis and cell wall-related processes were significantly upregulated in the cfl2 mutant. The components of cell wall, such as lignin, cellulose, and some kinds of monosaccharide, were altered dramatically in the cfl2 mutant when compared with wild-type \"Jinhui10\" (WT). Taken together, CFL2, as a target gene of Roc5, plays an important role in the regulation of flag leaf shape by influencing epidermis and cell wall development.',\n",

However, reliable prognostic signatures based on assessments of stromal and immune components have not been well-established. This study aimed to identify stromal-immune score-based potential prognostic biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma. Stromal and immune scores were estimated from transcriptomic profiles of a liver cancer cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas using the ESTIMATE (Estimation of STromal and Immune cells in MAlignant Tumors using Expression data) algorithm. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was applied to select prognostic genes. Favorable overall survivals and progression-free interval were found in patients with high stromal score and immune score, and 828 differentially expressed genes were identified. Functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction networks further showed that these genes mainly participated in immune response, extracellular matrix, and cell adhesion. MMP9 (matrix metallopeptidase 9) was identified as a prognostic tumor microenvironment-associated gene by using LASSO and TIMER (Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource) algorithms and was found to be positively correlated with immunosuppressive molecules and drug response.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND\\nMetformin, as a first-line treatment for diabetes, interacts with many protein kinases and transcription factors which affect the expression of downstream target genes governing drug metabolism. Sulfotransferase, SULT2A1, one phase II metabolic enzyme, sulfonates both xenobiotic and endobiotic compounds to accelerate drug excretion. Herein, we designed experiments to investigate the effects and mechanisms of metformin on SULT2A1 expression in vitro.\\nMETHODS\\nThe hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HepaRG, was cultured with different concentrations of metformin. The cell viability was measured using CCK8 kit. HepaRG was used to evaluate the protein expression of pregnane X receptor (PXR), the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), SULT2A1, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and phosphorylation of AMPK (p-AMPK), respectively, at different concentrations of metformin with or without rifampin (human PXR activator) and CITCO (human CAR activator). The coregulators with CAR on SULT2A1 promoter response elements have also been characterized.\\nRESULTS\\nWe showed that metformin did not affect the basic expression of SULT2A1 but could suppress the expression of SULT2A1 induced by the activator of human CAR. Investigations revealed that metformin which could block CAR nuclear translocation further suppress SULT2A1. In addition, we found that the prevented CAR transfer into the nucleus by metformin was partially an AMPK-dependent event.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe present study indicated that the activation of AMPK-CAR pathway mediated the suppression of SULT2A1 by metformin. Metformin may affect the metabolism and clearance of drugs which are SULT2A1 substrates. The results that emerged from this work provide substantial insights into an appropriate medication in the treatment of diabetes patients.',\n",

A total of 32 ESD-C procedures were performed by 16 trainees. Each trainee operator performed two ESD-C procedures; one ESD-C was assisted by an expert (ESD-C-E), and the other was assisted by a non-expert (ESD-C-NE). The total procedure time of the ESD was set as the primary outcome, and en bloc resection rate, complete procedure rate, perforation rate, and each procedure time/speed for mucosal incision or submucosal dissection were set as the secondary outcomes. In addition, we investigated factors associated with the difficulty of ESD including incompletion of ESD procedure, a long procedure time (≥ 20 min) or intraoperative perforation.\\nRESULTS\\nThe median total procedure time of the ESD-C-E was significantly shorter than that of the ESD-C-NE (12.9 min vs 21.9 min, P = 0.001). The en bloc resection rate was 100% in both groups. Complete resection rates of the ESD-C-E and ESD-C-NE groups were 100% and 93.8%, respectively. No intraoperative perforation was observed in both groups. In the multivariate analysis, assistant skill was significantly associated with the difficulty of ESD, with the highest odds ratio of 16.5.\\nCONCLUSION\\nAssistance by an expert is an important factor when trainees perform ESD-C procedures.\",\n",

We identified and analyzed 37 AHL genes in poplar (Populus trichocarpa). Phylogenetic analysis classified the PtrAHL members into three subfamilies based on their conserved domain. All PtrAHL paralogous pairs evolved under purifying selection. The promoter analysis revealed the presence of stress-related and phytohormone-related cis-elements of the PtrAHL genes. Our analysis of the tissue-specific expression pattern of PtrAHL genes indicated their significance in tissue and organ development. Network-based prediction suggested that PtrAHL genes may interact with histone deacetylases (HDAC) and participate in the development of organs, such as roots. Drought negatively impacts plant growth and development. ABA is produced under osmotic stress condition, and it takes an important part in the stress response and tolerance of plants. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that PtrAHL genes were induced by drought stress and ABA treatment. These insights into the expression of PtrAHL genes under stress provide a basis for PtrAHL gene functional analysis.

In this study, 31 FEX genes were identified across 19 plant species. Camphor Resistance (CrcB) domain was found to be present in all the identified FEX genes in plants. FEX genes were sequentially very conserved among the plants and are located mostly in chloroplast and mitochondria. The tertiary structure (3D) of AtFEX1 suggests that FEX genes of plants possess pore I and pore II, necessary for fluoride export. The TTFSGWNQ and GCLSTVSTF motifs were found to be well conserved in pore I and pore II. Phenylalanine (Phe/F) was also present in both the motifs, necessary for fluoride ions recognition and export. Cis-acting analysis in promoter sequences of plant FEX revealed several elements associated with various functions such as phytohormone signaling, integrating biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants. Prolong fluoride exposure causes necrosis in young leaves in Vigna radiata. Expression of VrFEX1 and VrFEX2 were highly induced under exogenous fluoride, thus suggesting a possible role in fluoride detoxification.\\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-021-02677-z.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The incidence of bone metastases in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has increased prominently over the past decade owing to the prolonged overall survival of HCC patients. However, the mechanisms underlying HCC bone-metastasis remain largely unknown. In the current study, HCC-secreted lectin galactoside-binding soluble 3 (LGALS3) is found to be significantly upregulated and correlates with shorter bone-metastasis-free survival of HCC patients. Overexpression of LGALS3 enhances the metastatic capability of HCC cells to bone and induces skeletal-related events by forming a bone pre-metastatic niche via promoting osteoclast fusion and podosome formation. Mechanically, ubiquitin ligaseRNF219-meidated α-catenin degradation prompts YAP1/β-catenin complex-dependent epigenetic modifications of LGALS3 promoter, resulting in LGALS3 upregulation and metastatic bone diseases. Importantly, treatment with verteporfin, a clinical drug for macular degeneration, decreases LGALS3 expression and effectively inhibits skeletal complications of HCC. These findings unveil a plausible role for HCC-secreted LGALS3 in pre-metastatic niche and can suggest a promising strategy for clinical intervention in HCC bone-metastasis.',\n",

Clusterin (CLU) is implicated to play important oncogenic roles in cancer via promoting various downstream oncogenic pathways. Here, protein kinase D3 (PRKD3) is defined to be a key regulator of CLU in promoting TNBC tumor growth. Mechanically, PRKD3 with kinase activity binding to CLU is critical for CLU protein stability via inhibiting CLU's lysosomal distribution and degradation. CLU and PRKD3 protein level are significantly elevated and positively correlated in collected TNBC tumor samples. CLU silencer (OGX-011) and PRKDs inhibitor (CRT0066101) can both result in impressive tumor growth suppression in vitro and in vivo, suggesting targeting CLU and its key regulator-PRKD3 are promisingly efficient against TNBC. Finally, secreted CLU (sCLU) is found to be elevated in serums from TNBC patients and reduced in serum from TNBC murine models post OGX-011 and/or CRT0066101 treatment, suggesting serum sCLU is a promising blood-based biomarker for clinical management of TNBC. Taken together, this study provides a thorough molecular basis as well as preclinical evidences for targeting CLU pathway as a new promising strategy against TNBC via revealing PRKD3 as the key regulator of CLU in TNBC.\",\n",

Suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1 (SUV39H1), which encodes a histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase, has been reported to act as an oncogene in many cancers. However, it is unclear whether SUV39H1 is involved in ccRCC. Here, we report that SUV39H1 expression is frequently upregulated in ccRCC tumors and is significantly correlated with ccRCC progression. SUV39H1 expression level is an independent risk factor for cancer prognosis, and integration with several known prognostic factors predicted ccRCC patient prognosis with improved accuracy than the conventional SSIGN (stage, size, grade and necrosis) prognostic model. Mechanistically, we discovered that siRNA knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of SUV39H1 induced iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation, leading to ferroptosis that disrupted ccRCC cell growth in\\xa0vitro and in\\xa0vivo. We also show that SUV39H1 deficiency modulated the H3K9me3 status of the DPP4 (dipeptidyl-peptidase-4) gene promoter, resulting in upregulation of its expression that contributes to ferroptosis.

We screened differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) between high and low tumor mutation burden (TMB) STAD samples. Using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method, 33 DElncRNAs were chosen to establish a lncRNA-based signature classifier for predicting TMB levels. The accuracy of the 33-lncRNA-based signature classifier was 0.970 in the training set and 0.950 in the test set, suggesting the expression patterns of the 33 lncRNAs may be an indicator of TMB in STAD. Survival analysis showed that a lower classifier index reflected better prognosis for STAD patients, and the index showed correlation with expression of immune checkpoint molecules (PD1, PDL1, and CTLA4), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and microsatellite instability.

Then DNA sequencing was performed on PCR products for the all 15 examined samples.\\nRESULTS\\nDNA sequencing analysis showed that the all C. hemipterus samples were similar, despite the minor nucleotide variations (within the range of 576 to 697bp) on average between 5 and 10 Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Subsequently, the results were compared with the database in gene bank which revealed close similarity and sequence homology with other C. hemipterus from other parts of the world.\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn conclusion, this study has demonstrated the ability of the COI gene to differentiate between the C. hemipterus populations from a few different locations in Iran. The current research is the first report of phylogenetic and genetic species diversity analysis conducted on C. hemipterus in Iran. These results provided basic information for further studies of molecular epidemiology, public health and pest control operators in Iran.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Model-based learned iterative reconstruction methods have recently been shown to outperform classical reconstruction algorithms. Applicability of these methods to large scale inverse problems is however limited by the available memory for training and extensive training times, the latter due to computationally expensive forward models. As a possible solution to these restrictions we propose a multi-scale learned iterative reconstruction scheme that computes iterates on discretisations of increasing resolution. This procedure does not only reduce memory requirements, it also considerably speeds up reconstruction and training times, but most importantly is scalable to large scale inverse problems with non-trivial forward operators, such as those that arise in many 3D tomographic applications. In particular, we propose a hybrid network that combines the multiscale iterative approach with a particularly expressive network architecture which in combination exhibits excellent scalability in 3D. Applicability of the algorithm is demonstrated for 3D cone beam computed tomography from real measurement data of an organic phantom. Additionally, we examine scalability and reconstruction quality in comparison to established learned reconstruction methods in two dimensions for low dose computed tomography on human phantoms.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Waste stabilization ponds (WSPs) are widely used for wastewater management owing to the simplicity of their design, low cost and the use of low-skilled operators. This study was carried out to assess the efficiency of a WSP system in reducing the levels of contaminants in hospital wastewater in a rural area of South Africa and to evaluate the current management of the WSP system. Sampling was conducted monthly from January to June 2014. Physicochemical and microbiological parameters were monitored using standard methods. The microbiological parameters (Escherichia coli and enterococci) in the effluent were higher than those in the influent in some sampling months. Also, low pathogen removal efficiency (<1 log reduction) was recorded. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the effluent (82-200 mg/L) exceeded the South African Department of Water Affairs for wastewater discharge guideline value of 75 mg/L although reduction efficiencies of 7.7%, 49.1% and 31.1% were observed for the months of February, April and June, respectively. The WSP system did not show a general trend of contaminant reduction except for Zn (5.5-94.8%). The Siloam WSP is not functioning properly and is releasing effluent of poor quality into the receiving river. It is recommended that the WSP system be expanded to cater for the extra load of wastewater it receives, also desludging should be performed as recommended for such systems. Continuous monitoring of the system for compliance to regulatory guideline should be routinely performed.',\n",

Experimental solubility and Hansen solubility parameters were obtained in ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethylene glycol, oleic acid, span 80, limonene, eugenol, transcutol (THP), labrasol, and propylene glycol. Thermodynamic functional parameters and computational models (van't Hoff and Apelblat) validated the determined solubility in various solvents at T = 298.2 K to 318.2 K and P = 0.1 MPa. The HSPiP software estimated the solubility parameters in the solvents. The maximum mole fractional solubility values of KETO were found to be in an order as oleic acid (8.5 × 10-3) > limonene (7.3 × 10-3) > span 80 (6.9 × 10-2) > THP (4.9 × 10-2) > eugenol (4.5 × 10-3) at T = 318.2 K. The results of the apparent thermodynamic analysis confirmed that the dissolution rate was endothermic and entropy driven. The GastroPlus program predicted significantly high permeation of KETO (79.1%) in human skin from the KETO-THP construct as compared to drug solution (38%) and excellent immediate release from THP-solubilized construct (90% < 1 h). Hence, THP could be a better option for topical, transdermal, and oral formulation.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Fetal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is challenged by the fetal movements and maternal breathing. Although fast MRI sequences allow artifact free acquisition of individual 2D slices, motion commonly occurs in between slices acquisitions. Motion correction for each slice is thus very important for reconstruction of 3D fetal brain MRI, but is highly operator-dependent and time-consuming. Approaches based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved encouraging performance on prediction of 3D motion parameters of arbitrarily oriented 2D slices, which, however, does not capitalize on important brain structural information. To address this problem, we propose a new multi-task learning framework to jointly learn the transformation parameters and tissue segmentation map of each slice, for providing brain anatomical information to guide the mapping from 2D slices to 3D volumetric space in a coarse to fine manner. In the coarse stage, the first network learns the features shared for both regression and segmentation tasks. In the refinement stage, to fully utilize the anatomical information, distance maps constructed based on the coarse segmentation are introduced to the second network. Finally, incorporation of the signed distance maps to guide the regression and segmentation together improves the performance in both tasks. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in reducing the motion prediction error and obtaining satisfactory tissue segmentation results simultaneously, compared with state-of-the-art methods.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Lysyl oxidase (LOX) is a copper-containing enzyme and its overexpression in tumor tissues promote tumor metastasis through the crosslinking of extracellular matrix. Our previous report demonstrated that LOX expression is significantly increased in human leukemic THP-1 cell-derived M2-like macrophages, and histone modification plays a key role in its induction. However, the rigorous mechanism of LOX regulation remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of functional transcription factors, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) in LOX regulation in M2-like macrophages. HIF1α expression was significantly increased in M2-like macrophages, and HIF1α inhibitor, TX402, suppressed LOX induction. The significant STAT3 activation was also observed in M2-like macrophages. Additionally, LOX induction was canceled in the presence of STAT3 inhibitor, S3I-201, suggesting that HIF1α and STAT3 pathways play a critical role in LOX induction. On the other hand, our ChIP results clearly indicated that the enrichment of FOXO1 within the lox promoter region was dramatically decreased in M2-like macrophages. In this context, knockdown of FOXO1 further enhanced LOX induction. LOX induction and HIF1α binding to the lox promoter region were suppressed in FOXO1-overexpressed cells, suggesting that the FOXO1 binding to the lox promoter region counteracted HIF1α binding to that region. Overall, the present data suggested that both of HIF1α and STAT3 were required for LOX induction in M2-like macrophages, and loss of FOXO1 within the lox promoter region facilitated HIF1α binding to that region which promoted LOX induction.',\n",

This study constructed the overexpression vector of transcription factor PnbHLH of Panax notoginseng. The combination of PnbHLH overexpression and RNAi of the key enzyme gene PnCAS involved in the phytosterol biosynthesis was achieved in P. notoginseng cells, thus exploring the biosynthetic regulation of P. notoginseng saponins(PNS) by the synergistic effect of PnbHLH overexpression and PnCAS RNAi. The results showed that the PnbHLH transcription factor interacted with the promoters of key enzyme genes PnDS, PnSS and PnSE in the biosynthetic pathway of PNS, and then regulated the expression levels of key enzyme genes and affected the biosynthesis of saponins indirectly. Further study indicated that the synergistic effect of PnbHLH overexpression and PnCAS RNAi was a more effective approach to regulate the biosynthesis of saponins. Compared with the wild type and PnCAS RNAi cells of P. notoginseng, the contents of total saponins and monomeric saponins(Rd, Rb_1, Re, Rg_1 and R_1) were increased to some extent in the cell lines of PnbHLH overexpression and PnCAS RNAi. This indicated that the two ways of forward regulation and reverse regulation of saponin biosynthesis showed superposition effect. This study explored a more rational and efficient regulation strategy of PNS biosynthesis based on the advantages of multi-point regulation of transcription factors as well as the down-regulation of by-product synthesis of saponins.',\n",

Then the in vitro toxicity was evaluated by human keratinocyte cytotoxicity. In vivo skin irritation potency was also evaluated through pathological observation after topical administration. The components, especially those located in stratum corneum, were analyzed by GC-MS. The main components, namely monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, of EOs extracted from CM with hot property,were detected for the interaction with keratino-lipid ceramide 3 by molecular simulation technology; and the interaction energy value was calculated based on the optimal conformation. It was found that the skin cell toxicity of EOs from CM with hot property was significantly higher than that of EOs from CM with warm property. However, there was no significant difference between them by in vivo skin irritation evaluation. Whether from CM with hot property or warm property, EOs showed a significant reduced toxicity compared with azone. Sesquiterpenes(33.56%±19.38%) were found to be one of the main components in EOs from CM with hot property, while almost no sesquiterpenes was found in EOs from CM with warm property. After topical administration of EOs from CM with hot property, sesquiterpenes were demonstrated to be prone to locate in stratum corneum. The results of molecular simulation also revealed that the interaction between sesquiterpenes and ceramide 3 was significantly stronger than that of monoterpenes(P&lt;0.01). In conclusion, the location of sesquiterpenes in stratum corneum resulted in the significant difference between in vitro skin cell toxicity and in vivo skin irritation potency.

       "  'abstract': 'The most direct approach to determining if two aqueous solutions will phase-separate upon mixing is to exhaustively screen them in a pair-wise fashion. This is a time-consuming process that involves preparation of numerous stock solutions, precise transfer of highly concentrated and often viscous solutions, exhaustive agitation to ensure thorough mixing, and time-sensitive monitoring to observe the presence of emulsion characteristics indicative of phase separation. Here, we examined the pair-wise mixing behavior of 68 water-soluble compounds by observing the formation of microscopic phase boundaries and droplets of 2278 unique 2-component solutions. A series of machine learning classifiers (artificial neural network, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector classifier) were then trained on physicochemical property data associated with the 68 compounds and used to predict their miscibility upon mixing. Miscibility predictions were then compared to the experimental observations. The random forest classifier was the most successful classifier of those tested, displaying an average receiver operator characteristic area under the curve of 0.74. The random forest classifier was validated by removing either one or two compounds from the input data, training the classifier on the remaining data and then predicting the miscibility of solutions involving the removed compound(s) using the classifier. The accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of the random forest classifier were 0.74, 0.80, and 0.51, respectively, when one of the two compounds to be examined was not represented in the training data. When asked to predict the miscibility of two compounds, neither of which were represented in the training data, the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity values for the random forest classifier were 0.70, 0.82 and 0.29, respectively. Thus, there is potential for this machine learning approach to improve the design of screening experiments to accelerate the discovery of aqueous two-phase systems for numerous scientific and industrial applications.',\n",

Forceful exertions, repetitive tasks, awkward postures, frequent manual labor, and vibration were also significantly associated with MSS, with adjusted ORs ranging from 1.8 to 3.3. Recommended preventive techniques were not protective for MSS. New effective strategies are needed to reduce the high burden of musculoskeletal outcomes among farmers and agricultural workers.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE\\nIt is well known that microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) is associated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance in colorectal cancer. MSI-H is the phenotype of DNA mismatch repair deficiency (MMR-D), mainly occurring due to hypermethylation of MLH1 promoter CpG island. However, the mechanisms of MMR-D/MSI-H are unclear. We aim to investigate the pathway of MMR-D/MSI-H involved in 5-FU resistance.\\nEXPERIMENTAL APPROACH\\nHuman colorectal cancer specimens were diagnosed for MSI-H by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Proteome microarray interactome assay was performed to screen nuclear proteins interacting with ATG5. Nuclear ATG5 and ATG5-Mis18α overexpression were analysed in ATG5high colorectal cancer bearing mice. The methylation assay determined the hypermethylation of hMLH1 promoter CpG island in freshly isolated human colorectal cancer tissue samples and HT29atg5 and SW480atg5 cancer cells.\\nKEY RESULTS\\nIn ATG5high colorectal cancer patients, 5-FU-based therapy resulted in nuclear translocation of ATG5, leading to MSI-H. Colorectal cancer in Atg5 Tg mice demonstrated 5-FU resistance, compared to Atg5+/- and WT mice. Proteome microarray assay identified Mis18α, a protein localized on the centromere and a source for methylation of the underlying chromatin, which responded to the translocated nuclear ATG5 leading to ATG5-Mis18α conjugate overexpression. This resulted in MLH1 deficiency due to hypermethylation of hMLH1 promoter CpG island, while the deletion of nuclear Mis18α failed to induce ATG5-Mis18α complex and MMR-D/MSI-H.\\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\\nNuclear ATG5 resulted in MMR-D/MSI-H through its interaction with Mis18α in ATG5high colorectal cancer cells. We suggest that ATG5-Mis18α or Mis18α may be a therapeutic target for treating colorectal cancer.',\n",

Herein, in silico analyses of multiple expression data sets on 1354 acute leukemia samples revealed a widespread presence of ZNF423 in various subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Average expression of ZNF423 was highest in ETV6-RUNX1, B-other, and TCF3-PBX1 ALL followed by BCR-ABL, hyperdiploid ALL, and KMT2A-rearranged ALL. In a KMT2A-AFF1 pro-B ALL model, a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genetic ablation of ZNF423 decreased cell viability and significantly prolonged survival of mice upon xenotransplantation. For the first time, we characterized the genome-wide binding pattern of ZNF423, its impact on the chromatin landscape, and differential gene activities in a B-lineage context. In general, chromatin-bound ZNF423 was associated with a depletion of activating histone marks. At the transcriptional level, EBF1-dependent transactivation was disrupted by ZNF423, whereas repressive and pioneering activities of EBF1 were not discernibly impeded. Unexpectedly, we identified an enrichment of ZNF423 at canonical EBF1-binding sites also in the absence of EBF1, which was indicative of intrinsic EBF1-independent ZNF423 activities. A genome-wide motif search at EBF1 target gene loci revealed that EBF1 and ZNF423 co-regulated genes often contain SMAD1/SMAD4-binding motifs as exemplified by the TGFB1 promoter, which was repressed by ZNF423 outcompeting EBF1 by depending on its ability to bind EBF1 consensus sites and to interact with EBF1 or SMADs. Overall, these findings underscore the wide scope of ZNF423 activities that interfere with B-cell lymphopoiesis and contribute to leukemogenesis.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Many chemical and biological systems involve reacting species with vastly different numbers of molecules/agents. Hybrid simulations model such phenomena by combining discrete (e.g., agent-based) and continuous (e.g., partial differential equation- or PDE-based) descriptors of the dynamics of reactants with small and large numbers of molecules/agents, respectively. We present a stochastic hybrid algorithm to model a stage of the immune response to inflammation, during which leukocytes reach a pathogen via chemotaxis. While large numbers of chemoattractant molecules justify the use of a PDE-based model to describe the spatiotemporal evolution of its concentration, relatively small numbers of leukocytes and bacteria involved in the process undermine the veracity of their continuum treatment by masking the effects of stochasticity and have to be treated discretely. Motility and interactions between leukocytes and bacteria are modeled via random walk and a stochastic simulation algorithm, respectively. Since the latter assumes the reacting species to be well mixed, the discrete component of our hybrid algorithm deploys stochastic operator splitting, in which the sequence of the diffusion and reaction operations is determined autonomously during each simulation step. We conduct a series of numerical experiments to ascertain the accuracy and computational efficiency of our hybrid simulations and, then, to demonstrate the importance of randomness for predicting leukocyte migration and fate during the immune response to inflammation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'HIV-1 infection in the central nervous system (CNS) causes the release of neurotoxic products from infected cells which trigger extensive neuronal loss. Clinically, this results in HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). However, the effects on neuroprotective factors in the brain remain poorly understood and understudied in this situation. HAND is a multifactorial process involving several players, and the complex cellular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated yet. In this study, we reported that HIV-1 infection of astrocytes limits their potential to express the protective chemokine fractalkine in response to an inflammatory environment. We next confirmed that this effect was not due to a default in its shedding from the cell surface. We then investigated the biological mechanism responsible for this reduced fractalkine expression and found that HIV-1 infection specifically blocks the interaction of transcription factor NF-κB on its promoter with no effect on other cytokines. Moreover, we demonstrated that fractalkine production in astrocytes is regulated in response to immune factors secreted by infected/activated microglia and macrophages. In contrast, we observed that conditioned media from these infected cells also trigger neuronal apoptosis. At last, we demonstrated a strong neuroprotective action of fractalkine on human neurons by reducing neuronal damages. Taken together, our results indicate new relevant interactions between HIV-1 and fractalkine signaling in the CNS. This study provides new information to broaden the understanding of HAND and possibly foresee new therapeutic strategies. Considering its neuro-protective functions, reducing its production from astrocytes could have important outcomes in chronic neuroinflammation and in HIV-1 neuropathogenesis.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'RATIONALE\\nHypertension in obesity has become a major threat for public health. Omentin-1, a novel adipokine, is down-regulated in obesity. Tetrahydroxystilbene glycoside (TSG) is the main ingredient extracted from Polygonum multiflorum Thunb (PMT), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb safely used for protecting cardiovascular systems over bimillennium. This study aims to examine (i) the impact of omentin-1 downregulation on obesity-related hypertension in murine models and the underlying mechanisms; (ii) whether tetrahydroxystilbene glycoside (TSG) improved endothelial dysfunction and obesity-associated hypertension via the increase of omentin-1.\\nMETHODS\\n(TSG-treated) male Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and omentin-1 knockout (OMT-/-) mice were used. In vitro, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and mature adipocytes differentiated from human visceral preadipocyte (HPA-v) were maintained in a co-culture system.\\nRESULTS\\nTSG was the main active component of PMT reducing systolic blood pressure and improving endothelial vasodilation. Fortnight-TSG treatment (100\\xa0mg/kg/day) increased serum omentin-1 level, also activated Akt/eNOS signaling and enhanced NO bioactivity; decreased expression of NOX2 and p22phox, suppressed production of superoxide and peroxynitrite anion. OMT-/- mice showed elevated blood pressure and impaired endothelial vasorelaxation, whereas hypotensive effect of TSG was blunted. In co-culture system, TSG incubation promoted binding of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) and Itln-1 promoter in adipocytes, activated Akt/eNOS/NO signaling and attenuated oxidative/nitrative stress in HUVECs. Suppression of Itln-1 with siRNA significantly blocked the protective effect of TSG in vitro.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nDown-regulation of omentin-1 induces endothelial dysfunction and hypertension in obesity. TSG treatment (at least partially) increases omentin-1 via promoting binding of PPAR-γ and Itln-1 promoter in adipose tissues, subsequently exerts protective effects on endothelial function via activating Akt/eNOS/NO signaling and attenuating oxidative/nitrative stress. These results suggest that TSG could be developed as a promising anti-hypertension agent that protects against endothelial dysfunction and obesity-associated cardiovascular diseases.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'OBJECTIVES\\nTo investigate the effect of scanned area on the accuracy and scan time of intraoral scans of an anterior implant.\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\nThree operators experienced in intraoral scanning (at least 2-year experience) performed partial and complete-arch scans (n = 10) of a dentate resin model with an implant at left central incisor site by using an intraoral scanner (Trios3; 3Shape, Copenhagen, Denmark). Each partial- or complete-arch scan was superimposed to a reference scan from a laboratory scanner (Ceramill Map 600; Amann Girrbach AG). Mean distance (selected 7 points) and angular (mesiodistal and buccolingual) scanbody deviations in test scans (trueness) and their variance (precision) were calculated. Linear-regressions (trueness), two-sided F-tests with a Bonferroni correction (precision), and multiple linear regressions (scan time), with the operator as a covariate were applied (alpha = .05).\\nRESULTS\\nInteractions were found between the scanned area and the operator for their effect on trueness of all points and angles, except for point 6 at implant-abutment connection in mesiodistal plane (p < .05). No significant difference was found between the precision of partial and complete-arch scans for all operators (p > .05). Partial-arch scan times were significantly shorter, overall, and for each operator (p < .001). No significant effect of scan time was found on the trueness of partial- and complete-arch scans (p > .05).\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nPartial and complete-arch scans of anterior single implants with an intraoral scanner resulted in similar accuracies, and were not influenced by the operator or the scan time. Scan times of partial-arch scans were significantly shorter.\\nCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE\\nPartial-arch scans can be used for the fabrication of monolithic anterior single implant crowns because the scans can be completed in shorter times without compromising the accuracy.',\n",

However, the in vivo consequences of vitamin D signalling directly within functionally mature osteoclasts is only partially understood. To investigate the in vivo role of VDR in mature osteoclasts, conditional deletion of the VDR under control of the cathepsin K promoter (CtskCre/Vdr-/-), was assessed in 6 and 12-week-old mice, either under normal dietary conditions (NormCaP) or when fed a low calcium (0.03 %), low phosphorous (0.08 %) diet (LowCaP). Splenocytes from CtskCre/Vdr-/- mice were co-cultured with MLO-Y4 osteocyte-like cells to assess the effect on osteoclastogenesis. Six-week-old CtskCre/Vdr-/- mice demonstrated a 10 % decrease in vertebral bone volume (p < 0.05), which was associated with increased osteoclast size (p < 0.05) when compared to Vdrfl/fl control mice. Control mice fed a LowCaP diet exhibited extensive trabecular bone loss associated with increased osteoclast surface, number and size (p < 0.0001). Interestingly, CtskCre/Vdr-/- mice fed a LowCaP diet showed exacerbated loss of bone volume fraction (BV/TV%) and trabecular number (Tb.N), by a further 22 % and 21 %, respectively (p < 0.05), suggesting increased osteoclastic bone resorption activity with the loss of VDR in mature osteoclasts under these conditions. Co-culture of CtskCre/Vdr-/- splenocytes with MLO-Y4 cells increased resulting osteoclast numbers 2.5-fold, which were greater in nuclei density and exhibited increased resorption of dentine compared to osteoclasts derived from Vdrfl/fl splenocyte cultures. These data suggest that in addition to RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis, intact VDR signalling is required for the direct regulation of the differentiation and activity of osteoclasts in both in vivo and ex vivo settings.',\n",

This is particularly true for marginalized groups, presenting a fundamental challenge to decreasing racial, economic, and gender-based health disparities. Physical and social environments influence genome function, including the transcriptional activity of core stress responsive genes. We studied the relationship between social experiences that are associated with systemic inequality (e.g., racial segregation, poverty, and neighborhood violence) and blood cell (leukocytes) gene expression, focusing on the activation of transcription factors (TF) critical to stress response pathways. The study used data from 68 women collected from a convenience sample in 2013 from the Southside of Chicago. Comparing single, low-income Black mothers living in neighborhoods with high levels of violence (self-reported and assessed using administrative police records) to those with low levels of violence we found no significant differences in expression of 51 genes associated with the Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity (CTRA). Using TELiS analysis of promoter TF-binding motif prevalence we found that mothers who self-reported higher levels of neighborhood stress showed greater expression of genes regulated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). These findings may reflect increased cortisol output from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, or increased GR transcriptional sensitivity. Transcript origin analyses identified monocytes and dendritic cells as the primary cellular sources of gene transcripts up-regulated in association with neighborhood stress. The prominence of GR-related transcripts and the absence of sympathetic nervous system-related CTRA transcripts suggest that a subjective perception of elevated chronic neighborhood stress may be associated with an HPA-related defeat-withdrawal phenotype rather than a fight-or-flight phenotype. The defeat-withdrawal phenotype has been previously observed in animal models of severe, overwhelming threat. These results demonstrate the importance of studying biological embedding in diverse environments and communities, specifically marginalized populations such as low-income Black women.\",\n",

Tumor screening through microsatellite instability and immunohistochemistry for MMR proteins was performed in 323 cases who met clinical criteria. BRAF-V600E and MLH1 promoter methylation were analyzed for all MLH1-deficient tumors. Patients with MMR deficient tumor proceeded to germline genetic testing.

Two recurrent variants in MLH1 and three novel pathogenic variants were identified. Furthermore, pathogenic germline variants with concomitant somatic MLH1 hypermethylation were found in 6% of cases. Predictive genetic testing was offered to 387 relatives. Overall, 127 tumors were diagnosed in 100 LS patients, from 62 unrelated families. Our molecular data provide new information about the spectrum of MMR mutations, which contributes to a better characterization of LS in Brazil.

The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shares some similarities with IPF. SARS-CoV-2 related genes have been reported to be broadly regulated by N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification. Here, we identified the association between m6A methylation regulators, COVID-19 infection pathways, and immune responses in IPF. The characteristic gene expression networks and immune infiltration patterns of m6A-SARS-CoV-2 related genes in different tissues of IPF were revealed. We subsequently evaluated the influence of these related gene expression patterns and immune infiltration patterns on the prognosis/lung function of IPF patients. The IPF cohort was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus dataset. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to identify the correlations among genes or cells. The CIBERSORT algorithm was used to assess the infiltration of 22 types of immune cells. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and proportional hazards model (Cox model) were used to develop the prognosis prediction model. Our research is pivotal for further understanding of the cellular and genetic links between IPF and SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may contribute to providing new ideas for prognosis assessment and treatment of both diseases.',\n",

The mechanisms through which information about chromatin states and epigenetic marks like histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) are transferred have been characterized in animals; these processes are less well understood in plants. Here, based on characterization of a dwarf rice (Oryza sativa) mutant (dwarf-related wd40 protein 1, drw1) deficient for yeast CTF4 (CHROMOSOME TRANSMISSION FIDELITY PROTEIN 4), we discovered that CTF4 orthologs in plants use common cellular machinery yet accomplish divergent functional outcomes. Specifically, drw1 exhibited no flowering-related phenotypes (as in the putatively orthologous Arabidopsis thaliana eol1 mutant), but displayed cell cycle arrest and DNA damage responses. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that DRW1 sustains normal cell cycle progression by modulating the expression of cell cycle inhibitors KIP-RELATED PROTEIN 1 (KRP1) and KRP5, and show that these effects are mediated by DRW1 binding their promoters and increasing H3K27me3 levels. Thus, although CTF4 orthologs ENHANCER OF LHP1 1 (EOL1) in Arabidopsis and DRW1 in rice are both expressed uniquely in dividing cells, commonly interact with several Polycomb complex subunits, and promote H3K27me3 deposition, we now know that their regulatory functions diverged substantially during plant evolution.

Aging, a major independent risk factor for atherosclerosis, correlates with a decline in circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). However, the precise effects of Igf1 on atherosclerosis remain unclear. In the present study, we assessed the essential role of hepatic Igf1, the major source of circulating IGF-1, in atherogenesis. We generated hepatic Igf1-deficient atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-null mice (L-Igf1-/-ApoE-/-) using the Cre-loxP system driven by the Albumin promoter. Starting at 6 weeks of age, these mice and their littermate controls, separated into male and female groups, were placed on an atherogenic diet for 18 to 19 weeks. We show that hepatic Igf1-deficiency led to atheroprotection with reduced plaque macrophages in females, without significant effects in males. This protection from atherosclerosis in females was associated with increased subcutaneous adiposity and with impaired lipolysis. Moreover, this impaired lipid homeostasis was associated with disrupted adipokine secretion with reduced circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Together, our data show that endogenous hepatic Igf1 plays a sex-specific regulatory role in atherogenesis, potentially through athero-promoting effects of adipose tissue-derived IL-6 secretion. These data provide potential novel sex-specific mechanisms in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.',\n",

Compared with the LPS group, phosphorylation of p65 and IκBα in the ML group were decreased and accumulation of NF-κB in the nucleus was significantly reduced by pretreatment with metformin.

However, improvement in sugar content has been stagnant among sugar crops for decades. Sorghum, especially sweet sorghum with high biomass, shown great potential for biofuel, has lower sugar content than sugarcane. To enhance sugar content, the sucrose isomerase (SI) gene, driven by stem-specific promoters (A2 or LSG) with a vacuole-targetted signal peptide, was transformed into the sorghum inbred line (T×430).\\nRESULTS\\nThe study demonstrated that transgenic lines of grain sorghum, containing 50-60% isomaltulose, accumulated up to eightfold (1000\\xa0mM) more total sugar than the control T×430 did (118\\xa0mM) in stalks of T0 generation. Subsequently, the elite engineered lines (A5, and LSG9) were crossed with sweet sorghum (Rio, and R9188). Total sugar contents (over 750\\xa0mM), were notably higher in F1, and F2 progenies than the control Rio (480\\xa0mM). The sugar contents of the engineered lines (over 750\\xa0mM), including T0, T1, F1, and F2, are surprisingly higher than that of the field-grown sugarcane (normal range 600-700\\xa0mmol/L). Additionally, analysis of physiological characterization demonstrated that the superior progenies had notably higher rates of photosynthesis, sucrose transportation, and sink strength than the controls.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThe genetic engineering approach has dramatically enhanced total sugar content in grain sorghum (T0, and T1) and hybrid sorghum (F1, and F2), demonstrating that sorghum can accumulate as high or higher sugar content than sugarcane. This research illustrates that the SI gene has enormous potential on improvement of sugar content in sorghum, particularly in hybirds and sweet sorghum. The substantial increase on sugar content would lead to significant financial benefits for industrial utilization. This study could have a substantial impact on renewable bioenergy. More importantly, our results demonstrated that the phenotype of high sugar content is inheritable and shed light on improvement for other sugar crops.',\n",

To elucidate the mechanism via which lignin is synthesised, we compared the lignin content, leaf hardness, cell wall thickness of palisade tissue, and gene expression patterns of lignin biosynthetic enzymes in three tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) varieties during maturation. The results consistently showed that during maturation, the accumulation of lignin gradually increased in tobacco leaves, reaching a peak at full maturity (45 days after topping), and then gradually decreased. Similarly, the transcript level analysis revealed that the gene expression pattern of NtPAL, NtC4H, NtCCoAOMT and NtCOMT were relatively high, and consistent with the lignin content changes. Thus, the four genes may play regulatory roles in the synthesis of tobacco lignin. Analysis of tissue expression patterns of the lignin synthesis-related gene showed that the NtPAL, NtC4H, Nt4CL, NtHCT, NtCCoAOMT, NtCOMT, NtCCR, NtCAD, and NtPAO were all expressed in stems, roots, and leaves. NtC3H and NtF5H were specifically expressed in stems and roots, and not in leaves. Consistently, the NtC3H promoter induced high GUS expression in stems and petioles, marginal in roots, and no GUS activity in leaves.

TGF-β and IL-6 promote Th17 differentiation; however, these cytokines have multiple targets. The identification and screening of additional molecules that regulate IL-17A and IL-22 responses in certain inflammatory conditions is of great clinical significance. In this study, we show that CDDO-Im, a specific Nrf2 activator, promotes IL-17A and IL-22 responses in murine Th17 cells. In contrast, CDDO-Im inhibits IL-17A response in multiple sclerosis patient-derived PBMCs. However, Nrf2 specifically regulates IL-22 response in vivo. Nrf2 acts through the regulation of antioxidant response element (ARE) binding motifs in target genes to induce or repress transcription. Promoter analysis revealed that Il17a, Rorc, and Ahr genes have several ARE motifs. We showed that Nrf2 bound to ARE repressor (ARE-R2) of Rorc and inhibited Rorc-dependent IL-17A transactivation. The luciferase reporter assay data showed that CDDO-Im regulated Ahr promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative PCR data showed that Nrf2 bound to ARE of AhR. Finally, we confirmed that the CDDO-Im-mediated induction of IL-22 production in CD4+ T cells was abrogated in CD4-specific Ahr knockout mice (Ahr ). CH-223191, a specific AhR antagonist, inhibits CDDO-Im-induced IL-22 production in CD4+ T cells, which further confirmed the AhR-dependent regulation. Collectively, our data showed that Nrf2 via AhR pathways regulated IL-22 response in CD4+ T cells.',\n",

Repression of lieAB and lftRS is exceptionally tight but strongly induced in the presence of aurantimycin. Repression depends on LftR, which belongs to subfamily 2 of the PadR-like transcriptional repressors. To better understand this interesting class of transcriptional repressors, we here deduce the LftR operator sequence from a systematic truncation and mutation analysis of the P  promoter. The sequence identified is also present in the P  promoter but not found elsewhere in the chromosome. Mutational analysis of the putative operator in the P  promoter confirmed its relevance for LftR-dependent repression. The proposed operator sequence was sufficient for DNA binding by LftR in vitro, and a mutation in this sequence affected aurantimycin resistance. Our results provide further insights into the transcriptional adaptation of an important human pathogen to survive the conditions in its natural reservoir.IMPORTANCEListeria monocytogenes is an environmental bacterium that lives in the soil but can infect humans upon ingestion, and this can lead to severe invasive disease. Adaptation to these entirely different habitats involves massive reprogramming of transcription. Among the differentially expressed genes is the lieAB operon, which encodes a transporter for the detoxification of aurantimycin, an antimicrobial compound produced by soil-dwelling competitors. While lieAB is important for survival in the environment, its expression is detrimental during infection. We here identify critical elements in the lieAB promoter and its transcriptional regulator LftR that contribute to habitat-specific expression of the lieAB genes. These results further clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the aurantimycin resistance of L. monocytogenes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'DNA strands consisting of multiple runs of guanines can adopt a noncanonical, four-stranded DNA secondary structure known as G-quadruplex or G4 DNA. G4 DNA is thought to play an important role in transcriptional and translational regulation of genes, DNA replication, genome stability, and oncogene expression in eukaryotic genomes. In other organisms, including several bacterial pathogens and some plant species, the biological roles of G4 DNA and G4 RNA are starting to be explored. Recent investigations showed that G4 DNA and G4 RNA are generally conserved across plant species. In silico analyses of several bacterial genomes identified putative guanine-rich, G4 DNA-forming sequences in promoter regions. The sequences were particularly abundant in certain gene classes, suggesting that these highly diverse structures can be employed to regulate the expression of genes involved in secondary metabolite synthesis and signal transduction. Furthermore, in the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the distribution of G4 motifs and their potential role in the regulation of gene transcription advocate for the use of G4 ligands to develop novel antitubercular therapies. In this review, we discuss the various roles of G4 structures in bacterial DNA and the application of G4 DNA as inhibitors or therapeutic agents to address bacterial pathogens.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Persistent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia is life threatening and occurs in up to 30% of MRSA bacteremia cases despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Isolates of MRSA that cause antibiotic-persistent methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia (APMB) typically have in vitro antibiotic susceptibilities equivalent to those causing antibiotic-resolving methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia (ARMB). Thus, persistence reflects host-pathogen interactions occurring uniquely in context of antibiotic therapy in vivo. However, host factors and mechanisms involved in APMB remain unclear. We compared DNA methylomes in circulating immune cells from patients experiencing APMB vs. ARMB. Overall, methylation signatures diverged in the distinct patient cohorts. Differentially methylated sites intensified proximate to transcription factor binding sites, primarily in enhancer regions. In APMB patients, significant hypomethylation was observed in binding sites for CCAAT enhancer binding protein-β (C/EBPβ) and signal transducer/activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). In contrast, hypomethylation in ARMB patients localized to glucocorticoid receptor and histone acetyltransferase p300 binding sites. These distinct methylation signatures were enriched in neutrophils and achieved a mean area under the curve of 0.85 when used to predict APMB using a classification model. These findings validated by targeted bisulfite sequencing (TBS-seq) differentiate epigenotypes in patients experiencing APMB vs. ARMB and suggest a risk stratification strategy for antibiotic persistence in patients treated for MRSA bacteremia.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND There have been few studies to evaluate early warning score (EWS) systems, or track and trigger systems (TTS), to identify early clinical deterioration in patients following brain tumor surgery who are admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) is an established method used in the U.K. National Health Service to improve care for in-hospital patients. This retrospective study from a single center aimed to compare the performance of NEWS2 with 24 other types of EWS to evaluate unplanned ICU admissions within 72 h after brain tumor surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 326 patients with brain tumors were included in the study. Patients who experienced unplanned ICU transfer after surgery (69 cases) were diagnostically matched with patients who did not require intensive care (257 controls). We collected the physiological variables to calculate the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, Youden index values, cutoff values, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values. RESULTS The NEWS2 identified postoperative brain tumor patients with AUROC (0.860, p=0.000). The Patient-At-Risk (PAR) score was higher than NEWS2 in terms of AUROC value (0.870, P=0.000), Youden index (0.589 vs\\xa00.542). CONCLUSIONS The findings showed that although the NEWS 2 performed well when used to evaluate unplanned ICU admissions within 72 h of postoperative brain tumor patients, the PAR score was also an accurate EWS.',\n",

A cis-regulatory mutation enables androgen-induced expression of csf1 in male fins. csf1-knockout males have reduced red coloration and require longer for mating, suggesting that coloration can contribute to male reproductive success. Contrary to expectations, non-red males are more attractive to a predatory fish than are red males.

Indeed, more than 95% of human genes undergo alternative splicing events (ASEs). In this study, we drew an all-around AS profile of thyroid cancer cells based on RNA-seq data. In total, there were 45,150 AS in 10,446 thyroid cancer cell genes derived from 506 patients, suggesting that ASEs is a common process in TC. Moreover, 1819 AS signatures were found to be significantly associated with the overall survival (OS) of TC patients. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses suggested that seven types of ASEs were associated with poor prognosis of TC (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Among them, exon skipping (ES) was the most common, with alternate promoter (AP) and alternate terminator (AT) coming second and third, respectively. Our results indicated that acceptor sites (AA) (AUC: 0.937), alternate donor sites (AD) (AUC: 0.965), AT (AUC: 0.964), ES (AUC: 0.999), mutually exclusive exons (ME) (AUC: 0.999), and retained intron (RI) (AUC: 0.837) exhibited an AUC greater than 0.6. In addition, age and risk score (All) were risk factors for TC patients. We also evaluated whether TC-ASEs are regulated by various splicing factors (SFs).

It is encoded by the His4r single-copy gene that is located outside of the histone gene cluster and expressed in a different pattern than H4, although the encoded polypeptides are identical. We generated a null mutant (His4rΔ42) which is homozygous viable and fertile without any apparent morphological defects. Heterozygous His4rΔ42 is a mild suppressor of position-effect variegation, suggesting that His4r has a role in the formation or maintenance of condensed chromatin. Under standard conditions loss of His4r has a modest effect on gene expression. Upon heat-stress the induction of the Heat shock protein (HSP) genes Hsp27 and Hsp68 is stronger in His4rΔ42 mutants with concordantly increased survival rate. Analysis of chromatin accessibility after heat shock at a Hsp27 regulatory region showed less condensed chromatin in the absence of His4r while there was no difference at the gene body. Interestingly, preconditioning before heat shock led to increased chromatin accessibility, HSP gene transcription and survival rate in control flies while it did not cause notable changes in His4rΔ42. Thus, our results suggest that His4r might play a role in fine tuning chromatin structure at inducible gene promoters upon environmental stress conditions.',\n",

To uncover how BCL11A initiates repression, we used CRISPR-Cas9, dCas9, dCas9-KRAB and dCas9-VP64 screens to dissect the γ-globin promoters and identified an activator element near the BCL11A-binding site. Using CUT&RUN and base editing, we demonstrate that a proximal CCAAT box is occupied by the activator NF-Y. BCL11A competes with NF-Y binding through steric hindrance to initiate repression. Occupancy of NF-Y is rapidly established following BCL11A depletion, and precedes γ-globin derepression and locus control region (LCR)-globin loop formation. Our findings reveal that the switch from fetal to adult globin gene expression within the >50-kb β-globin gene cluster is initiated by competition between a stage-selective repressor and a ubiquitous activating factor within a remarkably discrete region of the γ-globin promoters.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Nickel (Ni) is carcinogenic to humans, and causes cancers of the lung, nasal cavity, and paranasal sinuses. The primary mechanisms of Ni‑mediated carcinogenesis involve the epigenetic reprogramming of cells and the ability for Ni to mimic hypoxia. However, the exact mechanisms of carcinogenesis related to Ni are obscure. Nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1) is a stress‑response gene overexpressed in cancers, and is capable of conferring chemotherapeutic resistance. Likewise, activator protein 1 (AP‑1) is highly responsive to environmental signals, and has been associated with cancer development. In this study, NUPR1 was found to be rapidly and highly induced in human bronchial epithelial (BEAS‑2B) cells exposed to Ni, and was overexpressed in Ni‑transformed BEAS‑2B cells. Similarly, AP‑1 subunits, JUN and FOS, were induced in BEAS‑2B cells following Ni exposure. Knockdown of JUN or FOS was found to significantly suppress NUPR1 induction following Ni exposure, demonstrating their importance in NUPR1 transactivation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to induce AP‑1, and Ni has been shown to produce ROS. Treatment of BEAS‑2B cells with antioxidants was unable to prevent NUPR1 induction by Ni, suggesting that NUPR1 induction by Ni relies on mechanisms other than oxidative stress. To determine how NUPR1 is transcriptionally regulated following Ni exposure, the NUPR1 promoter was cloned and inserted into a luciferase gene reporter vector. Multiple JUN binding sites reside within the NUPR1 promoter, and upon deleting a JUN binding site in the upstream most region within the NUPR1 promoter using site‑directed mutagenesis, NUPR1 promoter activity was significantly reduced. This suggests that AP‑1 transcriptionally regulates NUPR1. Moreover, knockdown of NUPR1 significantly reduced colony formation and anchorage‑independent growth in Ni‑transformed BEAS‑2B cells. Therefore, these results collectively demonstrate a novel mechanism of NUPR1 induction following Ni exposure, and provide a molecular basis by which NUPR1 may contribute to lung carcinogenesis.',\n",

However, their role in regulating E2F target gene expression remains poorly understood. E2F transcription factors are critical regulators of cell cycle progression and are modulated by RB. Herein, putative ARID3‑binding sites\\xa0(BSs) in E2F target genes were identified, including Cdc2, cyclin\\xa0E1 and p107, and it was found that ARID3A and ARID3B bound to these BSs in living cells.

ARID3B knockdown blocked the transcription of Cdc2, cyclin\\xa0E1 and p107 in normal human dermal fibroblasts\\xa0(NHDFs), whereas the effects of ARID3A knockdown varied depending on the target genes.

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND\\nPrevious upper abdominal surgery (PUAS) is considered a contraindication to laparoscopic surgery. Whether LCBDE-PC is feasible and beneficial for patients with PUAS remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and benefits of LCBDE-PC for patients with PUAS.\\nMETHODS\\nFrom June 2011 to September 2019, 1167 patients who underwent laparoscopic procedures for choledocholithiasis were reviewed retrospectively. Perioperative outcomes were compared between patients with and without PUAS in un-matched and matched cohorts.\\nRESULTS\\nLCBDE-PC was performed successfully in 88.3% of patients with PUAS, and 92.5% of patients without PUAS (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Multivariate analysis showed that PUAS was not a risk factor that affected successful performance of LCBDE-PC. Although a higher rate of conversion to open surgery and longer operative time were observed in patients with PUAS, no significant differences were found between patients with and without PUAS in multivariate and propensity score analysis (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). A predictive nomogram for LCBDE-PC failure was developed based on potential predictors from the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model. Successful performance of LCBDE-PC was associated with operative time. A linear regression model for operative time showed impacted stone in the CBD and intraoperative laser use was the most important factor in determining the operative time.\\nCONCLUSION\\nLCBDE-PC is feasible and beneficial for patients with PUAS. However, patients with PUAS with a high possibility of LCBDE-PC failure from the nomogram and a longer operative time from the linear regression model should be cautious when undergoing LCBDE-PC.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) caused by RAG1 or RAG2 deficiency is a genetically determined immune deficiency characterized by the virtual absence of T and B lymphocytes. Unless treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), patients with RAG deficiency succumb to severe infections early in life. However, HSCT carries the risk of graft-versus-host disease. Moreover, a high rate of graft failure and poor immune reconstitution have been reported after unconditioned HSCT. Expression of the RAG genes is tightly regulated, and preclinical attempts of gene therapy with heterologous promoters have led to controversial results. Using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and an in vitro artificial thymic organoid system as a model, here we demonstrate that gene editing rescues the progressive T cell differentiation potential of RAG2-deficient cells to normal levels, with generation of a diversified T cell repertoire. These results suggest that targeted gene editing may represent a novel therapeutic option for correction of this immunodeficiency.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Cell wall invertase (CWIN) hydrolyses sucrose into glucose and fructose in the extracellular matrix and plays crucial roles in assimilate partitioning and sugar signalling. However, the molecular regulators controlling CWIN gene transcription remain unknown. As the first step to address this issue, we performed bioinformatic and transgenic studies, which identified a cohort of transcription factors (TFs) modulating CWIN gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana. Comprehensive bioinformatic analyses identified 18 TFs as putative regulators of the expression of AtCWIN2 and AtCWIN4 that are predominantly expressed in Arabidopsis reproductive organs. Among them, MYB21, ARF6, ARF8, AP3 and CRC were subsequently shown to be the most likely regulators of CWIN gene expression based on molecular characterization of the respective mutant of each candidate TF. More specifically, the obtained data indicate that ARF6, ARF8 and MYB21 regulate CWIN2 expression in the anthers and CWIN4 in nectaries, anthers and petals, whereas AP3 and CRC were determined primarily to regulate the transcriptional activity of CWIN4. TF-promoter interaction assays demonstrated that ARF6 and ARF8 directly control CWIN2 and CWIN4 transcription with AP3 activating CWIN4. The involvement of ARF8 in regulating CWIN4 expression was further supported by the finding that enhanced CWIN4 expression partially recovered the short silique phenotype displayed by the arf8-3 mutant. The identification of the five TFs regulating CWIN expression serves as a launching pad for future studies to dissect the upstream molecular network underpinning the transcription of CWINs and provides a new avenue, potentially, to engineer assimilate allocation and reproductive development for improving seed yield.',\n",

Patients were randomly divided into a training and a testing cohort. A machine-learning-based variable selection approach (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression) was used for the fitting of several multivariable predictive and prognostic models. The outcomes of interest included prediction of upstaging to carcinoma invading bladder muscle (MIBC), lymph node involvement, pT3/4 disease, cancer-specific survival (CSS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). The discriminatory ability of each model was either quantified by area under the receiver-operating curves or by the C-index. After validation and calibration of each model, a nomogram was created and decision-curve analysis was used to evaluate the clinical net benefit.\\nRESULTS\\nFor all outcome variables, at least one SIR biomarker was selected by the machine-learning process to be of high discriminative power during the fitting of the models. In the testing cohort, model performance evaluation for preoperative prediction of lymph node metastasis, ≥pT3 disease and upstaging to MIBC showed a 200-fold bootstrap-corrected area under the curve of 67.3%, 73% and 65.8%, respectively. For postoperative prognosis of CSS and RFS, a 200-fold bootstrap corrected C-index of 73.3% and 72.2%, respectively, was found. However, even the most predictive combinations of SIR biomarkers only marginally increased the discriminative ability of the respective model in comparison to established clinicopathological variables.\\nCONCLUSION\\nWhile our machine-learning approach for fitting of the models with the highest discriminative ability incorporated several previously validated SIR biomarkers, these failed to improve the discriminative ability of the models to a clinically meaningful degree. While the prognostic and predictive value of such cheap and readily available biomarkers warrants further evaluation in the age of immunotherapy, additional novel biomarkers are still needed to improve risk stratification.',\n",

However, the study of surface anatomy is less emphasized in medical and allied health science curricula, and the time devoted to direct engagement with the human body is limited. This scoping review was designed to answer one research question: \"What are the elements and strategies that are effective in teaching surface anatomy?\" The review was performed using a five-stage scoping review framework, including research question identification, relevant study identification, study selection, data charting, and result collating and reporting. Three databases were searched using two search terms combined with a Boolean operator: \"teaching\" and \"surface anatomy.\" The initial pool of 3,294 sources was assessed for duplication, and study eligibility was evaluated using inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were abstracted from 26 original articles by one researcher and verified by two other researchers. A thematic analysis was performed, and several elements of effective teaching strategies for surface anatomy were identified, namely contextualized teaching, embracing experiential learning, and learning facilitation. This review revealed that a multimodal approach was most commonly used in surface anatomy instruction. Hence, future research should explore the effectiveness of multimodal teaching strategies that adopt the three aforementioned primary elements of effective teaching in an authentic learning environment. It is pertinent to clarify the effectiveness of these teaching strategies by evaluating their impact on student learning, organizational changes, and benefits to other stakeholders.',\n",

Based on Monte Carlo (MC) resampling, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and partial least squares (PLS), a new ensemble strategy named MC-LASSO-PLS is proposed for NIR spectral multivariate calibration. In this method, the training subsets for building the sub-models are generated by sampling from both samples and variables to ensure the diversity of the models. In detail, a certain number of samples as sample subsets are randomly selected from training set. Then, LASSO is used to shrink the variables of the sample subset to form the training subset, which is used to build the PLS sub-model. This process is repeated N times and N sub-models are obtained. Finally, the predictions of these sub-models are used to produce the final prediction by simple average. The prediction ability of the proposed method was compared with those of LASSO-PLS, MC-PLS and PLS models on the NIR spectra of corn, blend oil and orange juice samples. The superiority of MC-LASSO-PLS in prediction ability is demonstrated.',\n",

In high glucose-challenged human islets and rat insulinoma cells overexpressing hIAPP, cell fractionation studies revealed increased accumulation of hIAPP. Unexpectedly, a significant fraction (up to 22%) of hIAPP was found in the nuclear soluble and chromatin-enriched fractions of cultured human islet and rat insulinoma cells. The nucleolar accumulation of monomeric forms of hIAPP did not have any adverse effect on the proliferation of β-cells nor did it affect nucleolar organization or function. However, intact nucleolar organization and function were essential for hIAPP expression under normal and ER-stress conditions as RNA polymerase II inhibitor, α-amanitin, reduced hIAPP protein expression evoked by high glucose and thapsigargin. Promoter activity studies revealed the essential role of transcription factor FoxA2 in hIAPP promoter activation in ER-stressed β-cells. Transcriptome and secretory studies demonstrate that the biosynthetic and secretory capacity of islet β-cells was preserved during ER stress.

However, the role of NUSAP1 in non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the biological function and underlying molecular mechanisms of NUSAP1 in NSCLC. NUSAP1 expression was measured in NSCLC tissues and cell lines via immunohistochemistry and western blotting, respectively. NSCLC cell lines stably inhibiting NUSAP1 were established to investigate its effects on cell proliferation, colony formation and invasion, and on in\\xa0vivo tumorigenicity. Additionally, the upstream and downstream mechanisms of NUSAP1 in regulating NSCLC progression were investigated. The results indicated that NUSAP1 expression was upregulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. High NUSAP1 expression was associated with tumor size, TNM stage, lymph node metastasis and poor patient survival, whereas knockdown of NUSAP1 inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation, colony formation and invasion. Furthermore, downregulation of NUSAP1 decreased the growth of NSCLC xenografts in\\xa0vivo. In addition, myocyte enhancer factor\\xa02D\\xa0(MEF2D) directly targeted the NUSAP1 promoter, thereby enhancing the mRNA and protein expression levels of NUSAP1. Moreover, the results demonstrated that MEF2D expression was upregulated in NSCLC tissues and was positively correlated with NUSAP1 expression. MEF2D‑knockdown decreased NSCLC cell proliferation, colony formation and invasion. NUSAP1 upregulation reversed the effects of MEF2D‑knockdown on NSCLC progression. Furthermore, it was observed that MEF2D‑knockdown inhibited the accumulation and nuclear translocation of β‑catenin, thereby repressing the activation of the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway in NSCLC cells, whereas NUSAP1 upregulation rescued the effects of MEF2D‑knockdown on the activation of the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway. In conclusion, the findings of the present study indicated that the MEF2D/NUSAP1 signaling pathway promoted NSCLC progression by inducing the activation of Wnt/β‑catenin signaling, and this novel mechanism may represent a potential treatment target for patients with NSCLC.',\n",

Although it has been revealed that TR4 causes chemoresistance in PCa via the activation of octamer‑binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4), the detailed mechanism remains unexplored. In the present study, it was revealed that inhibition of TR4 by shRNA in PCa enhanced the sensitivity to docetaxel in\\xa0vitro and in\\xa0vivo. TR4 induced the downregulation of miR‑145 by directly binding it to the promoter of miR‑145, which was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and luciferase assay. The overexpression of miR‑145 suppressed both the chemoresistance and the expression of OCT4 mRNA and protein. Additionally, the TR4 shRNA mediated re‑sensitization to docetaxel, along with the downregulated expression of OCT4, were reversed by the concurrent inhibition of miR‑145. The luciferase assay revealed that the activity of the wild‑type OCT4 3' untranslated region reporter was suppressed. This suppression diminished when the miR‑145 response element mutated. These findings suggest an undescribed regulatory pathway in PCa, by which TR4 directly suppressed the expression of miR‑145, thereby inhibiting its direct target OCT4, leading to the promotion of chemoresistance in PCa.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the niches that Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa coinhabit, the later pathogen produces phenazine antibiotics to inhibit the growth of S. aureus. Recently, a group of halogenated phenazines (HPs) has been shown to have potent antimicrobial activities against Staphylococci; however, no HP-resistant mutant has been reported. Here, we demonstrate that S. aureus develops HP-resistance via single amino acid change (Arg116Cys) in a transcriptional repressor TetR21. RNA-seq analysis showed that the TetR21R116C variation caused drastic up-regulation of an adjacent gene hprS (halogenated phenazine resistance protein of S. aureus). Deletion of the hprS in the TetR21R116C background restored bacterial susceptibility to HP, while hprS overexpression in S. aureus conferred HP-resistance. The expression of HprS is under tight transcriptional control of the TetR21 via direct binding to the promoter region of hprS. The R116C mutation in TetR21 significantly reduced its DNA binding affinity. Moreover, natural phenazine antibiotics (phenazine-1-carboxylic acid and pyocyanin) and a HP analog (HP-22) are ligands for the TetR21, regulating its repressor activity. Combining homology analysis and LC-MS/MS assay we demonstrated that HprS is a phenazine efflux pump. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first report of phenazine efflux pump in S. aureus.

Lo scopo di questo studio era di confrontare la tecnica laparoscopica e la EMC aperta per i tumori del colon sul lato destro in termini di campioni patologici e risultati a breve termine.\\nMATERIALE E METODI\\nI dati dei pazienti sottoposti a EMC laparoscopica (n=31) e EMC aperto (n=35) per adenocarcinoma del colon destro tra gennaio 2016 e giugno 2019 sono stati analizzati retrospettivamente. Sono stati confrontati dati demografici, parametri preoperatori, peroperatori e postoperatori e campioni di patologia dei due gruppi.\\nRISULTATI\\nNon ci sono state differenze statistiche tra il gruppo laparoscopico di EMC e il gruppo aperto di EMC in termini di età, sesso, indice di massa corporea, posizione del tumore, punteggio dell'American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), presenza di comorbidità, storia di altre neoplasie e precedente chirurgia addominale (p>0,05). I pazienti nel gruppo EMC laparoscopico presentavano lunghezze d'incisione più brevi, tempi operativi più lunghi, minore perdita di sangue operativa, tempi di mobilizzazione più brevi, recupero precoce del movimento intestinale, tempo più breve per dieta leggera, durata ridotta della degenza e dimensioni del tumore più piccole (p<0,05). Il numero medio di linfonodi raccolti in gruppi laparoscopici e di EMC aperti non era statisticamente significativo (29,83+8,90 e 31,34+13,10, rispettivamente). Non ci sono state differenze statistiche in termini di lunghezza del campione tra i gruppi laparoscopici e aperti di EMC (35,19+9,8 cm e 32,71+11,12 cm, rispettivamente). Il tasso di complicanze postoperatorie di 30 giorni era più elevato nel gruppo EMC aperto (35,5% contro 42,9%, rispettivamente), ma non statisticamente significativo (p>0,05).\\nCONCLUSIONI\\nPatologici (lunghezze dei campioni, lunghezze dei margini di resezione, numero di linfonodi e resezione R0) e risultati a breve termine del gruppo laparoscopico di EMC erano comparabili. Inoltre, la EMC laparoscopica ha conferito benefici a breve termine in termini di lunghezze di incisione più brevi, minore perdita di sangue operativa, riduzione dei tempi di mobilizzazione, recupero precoce dei movimenti intestinali, minor tempo di dieta leggera e riduzione della durata della degenza ospedaliera. Sulla base di questi risultati, la EMC laparoscopica può essere considerata come un approccio elettivo di routine per il carcinoma del colon destro.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'StCDPK2 is an early player in the salt stress response in potato plants; its overexpression promoted ROS scavenging, chlorophyll stability, and the induction of stress-responsive genes conferring tolerance to salinity. The salinity of soils affects plant development and is responsible for great losses in crop yields. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are sensor-transducers that decode Ca2+ signatures triggered by abiotic stimuli and translate them into physiological responses. Histochemical analyses of potato plants harboring StCDPK2 promoter fused to the reporter gene β-glucuronidase (ProStCDPK2:GUS) revealed that GUS activity was high in the leaf blade and veins, it was restricted to root tips and lateral root primordia, and was observed upon stolon swelling. Comparison with ProStCDPK1:GUS and ProStCDPK3:GUS plants revealed their differential activities in the plant tissues. ProStCDPK2:GUS plants exposed to high salt presented enhanced GUS activity in roots which correlated with the numerous stress-responsive sites predicted in its promoter sequence. Moreover, StCDPK2 expression increased in in vitro potato plants after 2\\xa0h of high salt exposure and in greenhouse plants exposed to a dynamic stress condition. As inferred from biometric data and chlorophyll content, plants that overexpress StCDPK2 were more tolerant than wild-type plants when exposed to high salt. Overexpressing plants have a more efficient antioxidant system; they showed reduced accumulation of peroxide and higher catalase activity under salt conditions, and enhanced expression of WRKY6 and ERF5 transcription factors under control conditions. Our results indicate that StCDPK2 is an early player in the salt stress response and support a positive correlation between StCDPK2 overexpression and tolerance towards salt stress.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'PURPOSE\\nIterative convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which resemble unrolled learned iterative schemes have shown to consistently deliver state-of-the-art results for image reconstruction problems across different imaging modalities. However, because these methods include the forward model in the architecture, their applicability is often restricted to either relatively small reconstruction problems or to problems with operators which are computationally cheap to compute. As a consequence, they have not been applied to dynamic non-Cartesian multi-coil reconstruction problems so far.\\nMETHODS\\nIn this work, we propose a CNN architecture for image reconstruction of accelerated 2D radial cine MRI with multiple receiver coils. The network is based on a computationally light CNN component and a subsequent conjugate gradient (CG) method which can be jointly trained end-to-end using an efficient training strategy. We investigate the proposed training strategy and compare our method with other well-known reconstruction techniques with learned and non-learned regularization methods.\\nRESULTS\\nOur proposed method outperforms all other methods based on non-learned regularization. Further, it performs similar or better than a CNN-based method employing a 3D U-Net and a method using adaptive dictionary learning. In addition, we empirically demonstrate that even by training the network with only iteration, it is possible to increase the length of the network at test time and further improve the results.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nEnd-to-end training allows to highly reduce the number of trainable parameters of and stabilize the reconstruction network. Further, because it is possible to change the length of the network at the test time, the need to find a compromise between the complexity of the CNN-block and the number of iterations in each CG-block becomes irrelevant.',\n",

In this study, random mutagenesis and site-directed genetic modification were used to improve the production of TGase in Streptomyces mobaraensis. First, S. mobaraensis DSM40587 (smWT) was subjected to atmospheric and room-temperature plasma mutagenesis, and then a mutant (smY2019) with a 5.5-fold increase in TGase yield was screened from approximately 3000 × 25 (round) mutants. Compared to smWT, smY2019 exhibits a 3.2-fold higher TGase mRNA level and two site mutations within the -10 region of the TGase promoter. The recombinant expression analysis in the TGase-deficient S. mobaraensis suggests that the mutated TGase promoter is more robust than the wild-type one. Finally, we integrated two additional TGase expression cassettes into the smY2019 genome, yielding the recombinant strain smY2019-3C with a 103% increase in TGase production compared to smY2019.

       "  'abstract': 'Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has emerged as a popular imaging modality in thyroid nodule diagnosis due to its ability to visualize vascular distribution in real time. Recently, a number of learning-based methods are dedicated to mine pathological-related enhancement dynamics and make prediction at one step, ignoring a native diagnostic dependency. In clinics, the differentiation of benign or malignant nodules always precedes the recognition of pathological types. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical temporal attention network (HiTAN) for thyroid nodule diagnosis using dynamic CEUS imaging, which unifies dynamic enhancement feature learning and hierarchical nodules classification into a deep framework. Specifically, this method decomposes the diagnosis of nodules into an ordered two-stage classification task, where diagnostic dependency is modeled by Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Besides, we design a local-to-global temporal aggregation (LGTA) operator to perform a comprehensive temporal fusion along the hierarchical prediction path. Particularly, local temporal information is defined as typical enhancement patterns identified with the guidance of perfusion representation learned from the differentiation level. Then, we leverage an attention mechanism to embed global enhancement dynamics into each identified salient pattern. In this study, we evaluate the proposed HiTAN method on the collected CEUS dataset of thyroid nodules. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of dynamic patterns learning, fusion and hierarchical diagnosis mechanism.',\n",

Prophylactic vaccines successfully prevent healthy people from acquiring HPV infections via HPV-specific antibodies. In order to treat established HPV-associated malignancies, however, new therapies are necessary. Multiple recombinant gorilla adenovirus HPV vaccine constructs were evaluated in NSG-β2m-/- peripheral blood mononuclear cell-humanized mice bearing SiHa, a human HPV16+ cervical tumor, and/or in the syngeneic HPV16+ TC-1 model. PRGN-2009 is a therapeutic gorilla adenovirus HPV vaccine containing multiple cytotoxic T cell epitopes of the viral oncoproteins HPV 16/18 E6 and E7, including T cell enhancer agonist epitopes. PRGN-2009 treatment reduced tumor volume and increased CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment of humanized mice bearing the human cervical tumor SiHa. PRGN-2009 monotherapy in the syngeneic TC-1 model also reduced tumor volumes and weights, generated high levels of HPV16 E6-specific T cells, and increased multifunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment.

       "  'title': 'IL-6 promotes MYC-induced B cell lymphomagenesis independent of STAT3.',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'The inflammatory cytokine IL-6 is known to play a causal role in the promotion of cancer, although the underlying mechanisms remain to be completely understood. Interplay between endogenous and environmental cues determines the fate of cancer development. The Eμ-myc transgenic mouse expresses elevated levels of c-Myc in the B cell lineage and develops B cell lymphomas with associated mutations in p53 or other genes linked to apoptosis. We generated Eμ-myc mice that either lacked the IL-6 gene, or lacked the STAT3 gene specifically in B cells to determine the role of the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 pathway in tumor development. Using the Eμ-myc lymphoma mouse model, we demonstrate that IL-6 is a critical tumor promoter during early stages of B cell lymphomagenesis. IL-6 is shown to inhibit the expression of tumor suppressors, notably BIM and PTEN, and this may contribute to advancing MYC-driven B cell tumorigenesis. Several miRNAs known to target BIM and PTEN are upregulated by IL-6 and likely lead to the stable suppression of pro-apoptotic pathways early during the tumorigenic process. STAT3, a classical downstream effector of IL-6, appears dispensable for Eμ-myc driven lymphomagenesis. We conclude that the growth-promoting and anti-apoptotic mechanisms activated by IL-6 are critically involved in Eμ-myc driven tumor initiation and progression, but the B cell intrinsic expression of STAT3 is not required.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In many animal models, primordial germ cell (PGC) development depends on maternally deposited germ plasm, which prevents somatic cell fate. Here, we show that PGCs respond to regulatory information from the germ plasm in two distinct phases using two distinct mechanisms in zebrafish. We demonstrate that PGCs commence zygotic genome activation together with the somatic blastocysts with no demonstrable differences in transcriptional and chromatin opening. Unexpectedly, both PGC and somatic blastocysts activate germ-cell-specific genes, which are only stabilized in PGCs by cytoplasmic germ plasm determinants. Disaggregated perinuclear relocalization of germ plasm during PGC migration is regulated by the germ plasm determinant Tdrd7 and is coupled to dramatic divergence between PGC and somatic transcriptomes. This transcriptional divergence relies on PGC-specific cis-regulatory elements characterized by promoter-proximal distribution. We show that Tdrd7-dependent reconfiguration of chromatin accessibility is required for elaboration of PGC fate but not for PGC migration.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'PVCre mice--> combined with AAV-FLEX vectors allowed efficient and specific targeting of PV+ interneurons in the striatum. However, diffusion of viral particles to the globus pallidus caused massive transduction of PV+ projection neurons and subsequent anterograde transport of the transgene product to the subthalamic nucleus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata. Different AAV serotypes (1 and 9) and promoters (CBA and human synapsin) were evaluated. The combination of AAV1, a moderate expression level (human synapsin promoter) and a precise adjustment of the stereotaxic coordinates in the anterior and dorsolateral part of the striatum were necessary to avoid transduction of PV+ GP projection neurons. Even in the absence of direct transduction due to diffusion of viral particles, GP PV+ projection neurons could be retrogradely transduced via their terminals present in the dorsal striatum. However, in the absence of diffusion, GP-Str PV+ projection neurons were poorly or not transduced suggesting that retrograde transduction did not significantly impair the selective targeting of striatal PV+ neurons. Finally, a prominent reduction of the number of striatal PV+ interneurons (about 50 %) was evidenced in the presence of the Cre recombinase suggesting that functional effects of AAV-mediated transgene expression in PV+ striatal interneurons in PVCre mice should be analyzed with caution.',\n",

Serum ROS, SOD, GSH-Px, and melatonin were measured by ELISA. Methylation microarrays detection and WGCNA were performed to identify hub methylated-sites. The methylation levels of hub-sites were validated in addtional samples. Moreover, mice were exposed to THS for 6 months mimicking exposure of human and the serum, liver, and pineal were collected. Oxidative stress-related indicators in serum, pineal, and liver were measured by ELISA. The expressions of mRNA and protein and methylation levels of hub-gene discovered in human data were further explored by RT-PCR, western-blot, and TBS. The results showed the participants exposed to THS had lower melatonin-level. 820 differentially methylated sites associated with THS were identified. And the hub-site located on the CYP1A2 promoter was identified, which mediated the association between THS and decreased melatonin-level. Decreased peak of serum melatonin, increased ROS and reduced SOD and GSH-Px in pineal and liver, and elevated CYP1A2 expression in liver was also found in the THS-exposed mice. Hypo-methylation of 7 CPG sites on the CYP1A2 promoter was identified, which accelerated the catabolism of melatonin. Overall, THS exposure is associated with abnormal melatonin catabolism through hypo-methylation of CYP1A2-promoter.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The aim of this study is to assess the radiation exposure of the patient and the medical staff during interventional cardiology procedures. Realistic exposure scenarios were developed using the adult reference anthropomorphic phantoms adopted by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP110Male and ICRP110Female), and the radiation transport code Geant4 (version 10.3). The calculated equivalent and effective doses were normalised by the simulated Kerma-Area Product (KAP), resulting in two conversion coefficients HT/KAP and E/KAP. To properly evaluate the risk of exposure, several dose-dependent parameters have been investigated, namely: radiological parameters (tube kilovoltage peak (kVp), type of projection, field size (FOV)), and operator positions. Four projections (AP,PA,LAO25° and RAO25°) were simulated for three X-ray energy spectra (80,100 and 120 kVp) with four different values of FOV (15×15\\xa0cm2,20×20\\xa0cm2,25×25\\xa0cm2 and 30×30\\xa0cm2). The results showed that the conversion coefficients values increase with increasing tube voltage as well as the FOV size. Recommended projection during the interventional cardiology procedures, whenever possible, should be the PA projection rather than AP projection. The most critical projection for the patient and the main operator is the RAO25° projection and the LAO25° projection respectively. The comparison of our results with the literature data showed good agreement allowing their use in the dosimetric characterization of interventional cardiology procedures.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Soil salinization resulting from shallow saline groundwater is a major global environmental issue causing land degradation, especially in semi-arid regions such as Australia. The adverse impact of shallow saline groundwater on soil salinization varies in space and time due to the variation in groundwater levels and salt concentration. Understanding the spatio-temporal variation is therefore vital to develop an effective salinity management strategy. In New South Wales, Australia, a hydrogeological landscape unit approach is generally applied, based on spatial information and expert operators, classifying the landscape in relation to landscape and climate. In this paper, a data science approach (random forest model) is introduced, based on historical groundwater quality and quantity data providing predictions in a 4-dimensional space. As a case study, we demonstrate the spatio-temporal factors impacting standing water levels (SWL) and associated salinity and predict the spatial and temporal variability in the Muttama catchment (1059\\xa0km2), in NSW, south eastern Australia. The random forest model explains 77% of the variance in the groundwater salinity (electrical conductivity) and 65% of the SWL. Spatial factors were the most significant variables determining the space-time variation in groundwater salinity and the occurrence of groundwater at the surface. Drilled piezometer depth and elevation are dominant factors controlling SWL, while salinity is mainly determined by underlying geology. The methodology in this study predicts salinity and SWL in the landscape at fine scales, through time, improving options for salinity management.',\n",

Genes regulated by REST/NRSF regulate multifaceted neuronal phenotypes, and their defects in the machinery cause neuropathies, disorders of neuron activity), autism and so on. In REST repressions, the N-terminal repressor domain recruits Sin3B via its paired amphipathic helix 1 (PAH1) domain, which plays an important role as a scaffold for histone deacetylase 1 and 2. This machinery has a critical role in maintaining neuronal robustness. In this study, in order to establish protein-protein interaction assays mimicking a binding surface between Sin3B and REST, we selected important amino acids from structural information of the PAH1/REST complex and then tried to reconstitute it using recombinant short peptides derived from PAH1/REST. Initially, we validated whether biotinylated REST interacts with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged PAH1 and whether another PAH1 peptide (PAH1-FLAG) competitively binds with biotinylated REST using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). We observed a direct interaction and competitive binding of two PAH1 peptides. Secondly, in order to establish a high-throughput and high-dynamic-range assay, we utilized an easily performed novel time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay, and closely monitored this interaction. Finally, we succeeded in establishing a novel high-quality TR-FRET assay and a novel interaction assay based on SPR.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A priority of modern agriculture is to use novel and environmentally friendly plant-growth promoter compounds to increase crop yields and avoid the indiscriminate use of synthetic fertilizers. Brassinosteroids are directly involved in the growth and development of plants and are considered attractive candidates to solve this problem. Obtaining these metabolites from their natural sources is expensive and cumbersome since they occur in extremely low concentrations in plants. For this reason, much effort has been dedicated in the last decades to synthesize brassinosteroids analogs. In this manuscript, we present the synthesis and characterization of seven steroidal carbamates starting from stigmasterol, β-sitosterol, diosgenin and several oxygenated derivatives of it. The synthesis route for functionalization of diosgenin included epoxidation and epoxy opening reactions, reduction of carbonyl groups, selective oxidation of hydroxyl groups, among others. All the obtained compounds were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, HRMS, and their melting points are also reported. Rice lamina inclination test performed at different concentrations established that all reported steroidal carbamates show plant-growth-promoting activity. A molecular docking study evaluated the affinity of the synthesized compounds towards the BRI1-BAK1 receptor from Arabidopsis thaliana and three of the docked compounds displayed a binding energy lower than brassinolide.',\n",

It is critically important to diagnose any inherited/acquired cardiac disease, including coronary artery disease, since it frequently represents the arrhythmogenic substrate in a substantial part of the athletes presenting with major VAs. New insights indicate that athletes develop a specific electro-anatomical remodeling, with peculiar anatomic distribution and VAs patterns. However, because of the scarcity of clinical data concerning the natural history of VAs in sports performers, there are no dedicated recommendations for VA ablation. The treatment remains at the mercy of several individual factors, including the type of VA, the athlete's age, and the operator's expertise. With the present review, we aimed to illustrate the prevalence, electrocardiographic (ECG) features, and imaging correlations of the most common VAs in athletes, focusing on etiology, outcomes, and sports eligibility after catheter ablation.\",\n",

Most ES cases carry the fusion of the Ewing Sarcoma Breakpoint Region 1 (EWSR1) and FLI1 (Friend leukemia virus integration site 1) genes, leading to an EWS-FLI1 fused protein, which is associated with autophagy, a homeostatic and catabolic mechanism under normal and pathological conditions. Following such interesting and controversial data regarding autophagy in ES, many clinical trials using modulators of autophagy are now underway in this field. In the present review, we summarize current data and clinical trials that associate autophagy with ES. In vitro studies highlight the controversial role of autophagy as a tumor promoter or a tumor suppressor mechanism in ES. Clinical and in vitro studies on ES, together with the autophagy modulators, suggest that caution should be adopted in the application of autophagy as a therapeutic target. Monitoring and targeting autophagy in every ES patient could eliminate the need for targeting multiple pathways in order to achieve the maximum beneficial effect. Future studies are required to focus on which ES patients are affected by autophagy modulators in order to provide novel and more efficient therapeutic protocols for patients with ES based on the current autophagy status of the tumors.',\n",

Two main isoforms of TSLP, classified as long- (lfTSLP) and short-form (sfTSLP), have been reported in human, but their expression patterns and role(s) in cancers are not yet clear. mRNA expression was examined by isoform-specific RT-PCR and RNA in situ hybridisation. Epigenetic regulation was investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR and bisulfite sequencing. Tumour progression was investigated by gene overexpression, cell viability assay, cancer organoid culture and transwell invasion. Signals were investigated by proteome profiler protein array and RNA-sequencing. With the use of isoform-specific primers and probes, we uncovered that only sfTSLP was expressed in the cell lines and tumour tissues of human ovarian and endometrial cancers. We also showed the epigenetic regulation of sfTSLP: sfTSLP transcription was regulated by histone acetylation at promoters in ovarian cancer cells, whereas silencing of the sfTSLP transcripts was regulated by promoter DNA methylation in endometrial cancer cells. In vitro study showed that ectopically overexpressing sfTSLP promoted tumour growth but not invasion. Human phosphokinase array application demonstrated that the sfTSLP overexpression activated phosphorylation of multiple intracellular kinases (including GSK3α/β, AMPKα1, p53, AKT1/2, ERK1/2 and Src) in ovarian cancer cells in a context-dependent manner. We further investigated the impact of sfTSLP overexpression on transcriptome by RNA-sequencing and found that EFNB2 and PBX1 were downregulated in ovarian and endometrial cancer cells, suggesting their role in sfTSLP-mediated tumour growth.

Here, we implemented bioinformatics models of human diseases using animal in vivo genome-wide RNA-Seq data to compare the effect of co-directed changes in the expression of orthologous genes on human reproductive potential and during the divergence of domestic and wild animals from their nearest common ancestor (NCA). For example, serotonin receptor 3A (HTR3A) deficiency contributes to sudden death in pregnancy, consistently with Htr3a underexpression in guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) during their divergence from their NCA with cavy (C. aperea). Overall, 25 and three differentially expressed genes (hereinafter, DEGs) in domestic animals versus 11 and 17 DEGs in wild animals show the direction consistent with human orthologous gene-markers of reduced and increased reproductive potential. This indicates a reliable association between DEGs in domestic animals and human orthologous genes reducing reproductive potential (Pearson's χ2 test p < 0.001, Fisher's exact test p < 0.05, binomial distribution p < 0.0001), whereas DEGs in wild animals uniformly match human orthologous genes decreasing and increasing human reproductive potential (p > 0.1; binomial distribution), thus enforcing the norm (wild type).\",\n",

While convergence results for EDMD require an infinite number of dictionary elements, recent studies have shown that only a few dictionary elements can yield an efficient approximation of the Koopman operator, provided that they are well-chosen through a proper training process. However, this training process typically relies on nonlinear optimization techniques. In this paper, we propose two novel methods based on a reservoir computer to train the dictionary. These methods rely solely on linear convex optimization. We illustrate the efficiency of the method with several numerical examples in the context of data reconstruction, prediction, and computation of the Koopman operator spectrum.

       "  'abstract': '8-methoxypsoralen is the most common drug in psoralen plus ultraviolet light irradiation therapy for the treatment of severe psoriasis. Despite of the efficacy, its classic oral administration leads to several serious adverse effects. However, the topical psoralen application produces a drug skin accumulation lower than that obtained by oral administration, due to the drug low skin permeability. In this paper, 8-methoxypsoralen loaded Penetration Enhancer-containing Vesicles were prepared using soy phosphatidylcholine and the penetration enhancer Transcutol® (5% or 10%) and characterized in terms of size, polydispersity index, zeta potential and encapsulation efficiency. No statistically significant differences in both size (~135 nm) and encapsulation efficiency (~65%) were found for different Transcutol® concentration. Transdermal delivery study assessed by Franz diffusion cells, showed that the 8-methoxypsoralen mainly accumulated into the stratum corneum. Moreover, after Penetration Enhancer-containing Vesicles application, the drug recovered in this layer is almost double of that delivered by conventional liposomes, while no significant difference was found from the different Transcutol® concentrations. Finally, biocompatibility checked by an MTT assay, demonstrated that the incubation of human keratinocytes for 24 h with 8-methoxypsoralen loaded Penetration Enhancer-containing Vesicles did not significantly reduce cell viability.',\n",

Statistical classification models were used to find diagnostic clusters of VOCs for the discrimination of HC, BPN and LC patients' early and advanced stages, as well as subtypes of LC. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves with 5-fold validations were used to evaluate the accuracy of these models.\\nRESULTS\\nThe analysis revealed that 20, 19, 19, and 20 VOCs discriminated LC from HC, LC from BPN, histology and LC stages respectively. The calculated diagnostic indices showed a large area under the curve (AUC) to distinguish HC from LC (AUC: 0.987, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.976-0.997), BPN from LC (AUC: 0.809, 95 % CI: 0.758-0.860), NSCLC from SCLC (AUC: 0.939, 95 % CI: 0.875-0.995) and Stage III from stage III-IV (AUC: 0.827, 95 % CI: 0.768-0.886). The comparison between the high-risk groups (BPN and HC smokers) and early stages LC resulted in the AUC of 0.756 (95 %CI: 0.681-0.817) for BPN vs. early stage LC and AUC of 0.986 (95 % CI: 0.972-0.994) for HC smoker vs. early stage LC.\\nCONCLUSION\\nVolatome of breath of the LC patients was significantly different from that of both BPN patients and HC and showed an ability of distinguishing early from advance stage LC and NSCLC from SCLC.

The alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) family is associated with alcohol metabolism in vivo. However, whether ADHs can act as biomarkers for BC and the underlying mechanism of them affecting BC are unclear. In the present study, the expression levels, prognostic values, epigenetic and genetic alterations, and regulatory networks of ADHs were explored in BC using public online database. Among ADHs family, the expression level of ADH2 is remarkably decreased in the BC and high expression level of ADH2 is significantly associated with better overall survival in BC. Decreasing mRNA expression level of ADH2 is due to DNA hypermethylation in the promoter rather than genetic alterations. ADH2 strongly correlates with pathways in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, and cytochrome P450 pathways in BC. Our finding provided novel insights into ADH2 in BC and implied that ADH2 could act as a novel biomarker for BC prognosis.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The protein p53 is a crucial tumor suppressor, often called \"the guardian of the genome\"; however, mutations transform p53 into a powerful cancer promoter. The oncogenic capacity of mutant p53 has been ascribed to enhanced propensity to fibrillize and recruit other cancer fighting proteins in the fibrils, yet the pathways of fibril nucleation and growth remain obscure. Here, we combine immunofluorescence three-dimensional confocal microscopy of human breast cancer cells with light scattering and transmission electron microscopy of solutions of the purified protein and molecular simulations to illuminate the mechanisms of phase transformations across multiple length scales, from cellular to molecular. We report that the p53 mutant R248Q (R, arginine; Q, glutamine) forms, both in cancer cells and in solutions, a condensate with unique properties, mesoscopic protein-rich clusters. The clusters dramatically diverge from other protein condensates. The cluster sizes are decoupled from the total cluster population volume and independent of the p53 concentration and the solution concentration at equilibrium with the clusters varies. We demonstrate that the clusters carry out a crucial biological function: they host and facilitate the nucleation of amyloid fibrils. We demonstrate that the p53 clusters are driven by structural destabilization of the core domain and not by interactions of its extensive unstructured region, in contradistinction to the dense liquids typical of disordered and partially disordered proteins. Two-step nucleation of mutant p53 amyloids suggests means to control fibrillization and the associated pathologies through modifying the cluster characteristics. Our findings exemplify interactions between distinct protein phases that activate complex physicochemical mechanisms operating in biological systems.',\n",

We employ a multi-omics pipeline including measurements of nascent RNA to characterize transcriptional changes upon acute hypoxia. We identify an immediate early transcriptional response that is strongly dependent on HIF1A and the kinase activity of its cofactor CDK8, includes indirect repression of MYC targets, and is highly conserved across cancer types. HIF1A drives this acute response via conserved high-occupancy enhancers. Genetic screen data indicates that, in normoxia, HIF1A displays strong cell-autonomous tumor suppressive effects through a gene module mediating mTOR inhibition. Conversely, in advanced malignancies, expression of a module of HIF1A targets involved in collagen remodeling is associated with poor prognosis across diverse cancer types. In this work, we provide a valuable resource for investigating context-dependent roles of HIF1A and its targets in cancer biology.',\n",

Here, we report the profiles of genetic alterations, chromatin accessibility and active enhancers, gene-expressions and anti-lymphoma drug-sensitivity of three newly established, patient-derived, xenograft (PDX) models of RT-DLBCLs, including CLR and clonally-unrelated (CLUR) to concomitant CLL.

LncRNA LOC554202 (LOC554202) was a newly identified tumor-related lncRNA. However, its expression and function in HCC remained unknown. In this study, we firstly reported that LOC554202 expression was distinctly upregulated in HCC specimens and cell lines. Clinical assays indicated that increased LOC554202 expression had a diagnostic value for HCC patients and was positively associated with advanced stages and poor clinical prognosis. Additionally, forkhead box O3(FOXO3) could bind directly to the LOC554202 promoter region and activate its transcription. Functionally, we observed that knockdown of LOC554202 suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress of HCC cells, and promoted apoptosis. Mechanistically, LOC554202 competitively bound to miR-485-5p and prevented the suppressive effects of miR-485-5p on its target gene basigin (BSG), which finally led to HCC metastasis, EMT, and docetaxel chemoresistance. Our data demonstrated that FOXO3-induced LOC554202 contributed to HCC progression by upregulating BSG via competitively binding to miR-485-5p, which suggested that the regulation of the FOXO3/LOC554202/miR-485-5p/BSG axis may have beneficial effects in the treatment of HCC.',\n",

Wide-area transepithelial sampling with 3-dimensional computer-assisted analysis (WATS3D) is an emerging technique used to collect esophageal samples. The aim of this study was to evaluate WATS3D as a diagnostic tool for detecting BE in addition to FB, compared to FB alone.\\nMETHODS\\nA retrospective observational cohort study was conducted and included patients who underwent screening for BE with WATS3D and FB between January 2015 and January 2019 across 3 endoscopy centers in Wichita, Kansas. The FB specimens were reviewed by community pathologists, while the WATS3D samples were sent to CDX technology labs, NY.\\nRESULTS\\nA total of 108 patients were screened for BE using both modalities concurrently.

       "  'abstract': \"This paper constructs an unconditionally stable explicit difference scheme, marching backward in time, that can solve a limited, but important class of time-reversed 2D Burgers' initial value problems. Stability is achieved by applying a compensating smoothing operator at each time step to quench the instability. This leads to a distortion away from the true solution. However, in many interesting cases, the cumulative error is sufficiently small to allow for useful results. Effective smoothing operators based on (-Δ)  , with real p > 2, can be efficiently synthesized using FFT algorithms, and this may be feasible even in non-rectangular regions. Similar stabilizing techniques were successfully applied in other ill-posed evolution equations. The analysis of numerical stabilty is restricted to a related linear problem. However, extensive numerical experiments indicate that such linear stability results remain valid when the explicit scheme is applied to a significant class of time-reversed nonlinear 2D Burgers' initial value problems. As illustrative examples, the paper uses fictitiously blurred 256 × 256 pixel images, obtained by using sharp images as initial values in well-posed, forward 2D Burgers' equations. Such images are associated with highly irregular underlying intensity data that can seriously challenge ill-posed reconstruction procedures. The stabilized explicit scheme, applied to the time-reversed 2D Burgers' equation, is then used to deblur these images. Examples involving simpler data are also studied. Successful recovery from severely distorted data is shown to be possible, even at high Reynolds numbers.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is widely used for the ablation of atrial fibrillation, with prior reports suggesting good efficacy. Due to the widespread use of three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping systems and advances in intracardiac echocardiography, fluoroless ablation has been made possible. Fluoroless ablation with a cryoballoon (CB), however, has not been widely performed because of the need to prove occlusion of the vein with contrast dye and fluoroscopy. The objective of this study is to show that CB ablation can be performed safely and effectively without fluoroscopy. A dual-center, case-control study was performed of patients undergoing CB PVI with a fluoroless approach and a control group with traditional fluoroscopic techniques. The absence of color-flow Doppler signals around the periphery of the CB on intracardiac echocardiography and an increase in mean pressure by 5 mmHg, loss of the A-wave, and an increase in the V-wave as measured with continuous-wave pressure monitoring were adopted as indicators of vein occlusion in the absence of fluoroscopy. Temperature at 30 seconds, minimum temperature, time to isolation, procedure length, and complications were evaluated. During the study period of November 15, 2018 to November 15, 2019, a total of 100 patients underwent CB PVI at the participating centers. A total of 50 patients were enrolled in the fluoroless arm [35 men (70%), mean age: 64.9 ± 12 years, mean left atrium size: 44.2 ± 16 mL/m2, left ventricular ejection fraction: 61% ± 5%], while 50 patients were enrolled in the control arm with similar characteristics. Four hundred forty-one 441 PVs were evaluated in the study cohort compared to 339 PVs in the control arm. When comparing fluoroless and traditional techniques, the mean temperature at 30 seconds was -31.7°C ± 6°C versus -32.8°C ± 5°C (p = 0.037), the minimum temperature was -47.4°C ± 6°C versus -47.7°C ± 9°C (p = 0.677), the time to isolation was 56.8 ± 28 seconds versus 74.8 ± 45 seconds (p = 0.212), and the procedure time was 102.2 ± 27.3 seconds versus 104.5 ± 16.9 seconds (p = 0.6436). Ultimately, this proof-of-concept study revealed that fluoroless ablation can be performed with success and efficiency outcomes similar to those of a traditional ablation approach. This suggests that the ablation of atrial fibrillation with CB can be performed safely and effectively without the use of fluoroscopy by experienced operators.',\n",

For this purpose, we intend as an attempt at investigating the fractional COVID-19 model through Caputo operator with order  . Employing the fixed point theorem, it is shown that the solutions of the proposed fractional model are determined to satisfy the existence and uniqueness conditions under the Caputo derivative. On the other hand, its iterative solutions are indicated by making use of the Laplace transform of the Caputo fractional operator. Also, we establish the stability criteria for the fractional COVID-19 model via the fixed point theorem. The invariant region in which all solutions of the fractional model under investigation are positive is determined as the non-negative hyperoctant   . Moreover, we perform the parameter estimation of the COVID-19 model by utilizing the non-linear least squares curve fitting method. The sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number   is carried out to determine the effects of the proposed fractional model's parameters on the spread of the disease. Numerical simulations show that all results are in good agreement with real data and all theoretical calculations about the disease.\",\n",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential role and effect of pterostilbene (PTE) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) on diabetic wound healing.\\nMETHODS\\nDiabetic rats were used to measure the epigenetic changes in both HSCs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). A cutaneous burn injury was induced in the rats and PTE-treated diabetic HSCs were transplanted for evaluation of wound healing. In addition, several biomedical parameters, including gene expression, oxidative stress, mitochondrial function and inflammation in macrophages, were also measured.\\nRESULTS\\nOur data showed that PTE had a much stronger effect than resveratrol on accelerating diabetic wound healing, likely because PTE can ameliorate diabetes-induced epigenetic changes to estrogen receptor β promoter in HSCs, while resveratrol cannot. Further investigation showed that bone marrow transplantation of PTE-treated diabetic HSCs restores diabetes-induced suppression of estrogen receptor β and its target genes, including nuclear respiratory factor-1 and superoxide dismutase 2, and protects against diabetes-induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines in both PBMCs and macrophages, subsequently accelerating cutaneous wound healing.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nHSC may play an important role in wound healing through transferring epigenetic modifications to subsequent PBMCs and macrophages by differentiation, while PTE accelerates diabetic wound healing by modulating diabetes-induced epigenetic changes in HSCs.

PCC 7120 (hereafter Anabaena) is a model cyanobacterium to study nitrogen fixation, cellular differentiation and several other key biological functions that are analogous in plants. As with any other organism, many genes in Anabaena encode an essential life function and hence cannot be deleted, causing a bottleneck in the elucidation of its genomic function. Antisense RNA (asRNA) mediated approach renders the study of essential genes possible by suppressing (but not completely eliminating) expression of the target gene, thus allowing them to function to some extent. Recently, we have successfully implemented this approach using the strong endogenous promoter of the psbA1 gene (D1 subunit of Photosystem II) introduced into a high-copy replicative plasmid (pAM1956) to suppress the transcript level of the target gene alr0277 (encoding a sigma factor, SigJ/Alr0277) in Anabaena. This protocol represents an efficient and easy procedure to further explore the functional genomics, expanding the scope of basic and applied research in these ecologically important cyanobacteria.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In comparison with full-length IgGs, antigen binding fragments (Fabs) are smaller in size and do not require the complexed post-translational modification. Therefore, Fab can be cost-effectively produced using an Escherichia coli (E. coli) expression system. However, the disulfide-bonds containing exogenous protein, including Fab, tend to form insoluble inclusion bodies in E. coli, which has been the bottleneck for exogenous protein expressions using this system. The secretory expression of proteins in periplasm or extracellular medium are promising strategies to prevent the formation of inclusion bodies to improve the efficiency to produce Fabs from E. coli. The extracellular expression is of particularly interest since it releases the product into the medium, while periplasmic expression yield is limited to the periplasm space. In addition, the extracellular expression allows for the direct harvesting of proteins from the culture supernatant, sparing the procedures of cell lysis and reducing contamination of host cell protein or DNA. Using anti-VEGF Fab as an example, here we provide a protocol based on the alkaline phosphatase (phoA) promoter and the heat-stable enterotoxin II (STII) leader sequence. Using phosphate starvation to induce the secretory expression, the protocol could be generally used for the efficient production of Fabs.',\n",

Here, we investigate the evolutionary patterns of Gli3 associated CNS-specific enhancers that have been reported so far. A subset of these enhancers has undergone an accelerated rate of molecular evolution in the human lineage in comparison to other primates/mammals.

The aim of this review is to summarize the evidence so far available and to guide clinicians in the selection of patients with chronic total occlusions that could benefit more from Coronary Sinus Reducer implantation.\\nRECENT FINDINGS\\nA recently published study suggests a clear value of this device in patients with chronic total occlusions. This is likely to be related to the presence of a well-developed collateral circulation. A careful evaluation of risks and benefits of both myocardial revascularization and Coronary Sinus Reducer implantation should be done in all the cases in order to better define the optimal strategy for the patient. The Coronary Sinus Reducer implantation has a rationale in patients with chronic total occlusion as an alternative or additional therapy to myocardial revascularization.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Cellular communication network factor (CCN) family members are multifunctional matricellular proteins that manipulate and integrate extracellular signals. In our previous studies investigating the role of CCN family members in cellular metabolism, we found three members that might be under the regulation of energy metabolism. In this study, we confirmed that CCN2 and CCN3 are the only members that are tightly regulated by glycolysis in human chondrocytic cells. Interestingly, CCN3 was induced under a variety of impaired glycolytic conditions. This CCN3 induction was also observed in two breast cancer cell lines with a distinct phenotype, suggesting a basic role of CCN3 in cellular metabolism. Reporter gene assays indicated a transcriptional regulation mediated by an enhancer in the proximal promoter region. As a result of analyses in silico, we specified regulatory factor binding to the X-box 1 (RFX1)\\xa0as a candidate that mediated the transcriptional activation by impaired glycolysis. Indeed, the inhibition of glycolysis induced the expression of RFX1, and RFX1 silencing nullified the CCN3 induction by impaired glycolysis. Subsequent experiments with an anti-CCN3 antibody indicated that CCN3 supported the survival of chondrocytes under impaired glycolysis. Consistent with these findings in vitro, abundant CCN3 production by chondrocytes in the deep zones of developing epiphysial cartilage, which are located far away from the synovial fluid, was confirmed in vivo. Our present study uncovered that RFX1 is the mediator that enables CCN3 induction upon cellular starvation, which may eventually assist chondrocytes in retaining their viability, even when there is an energy supply shortage.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The alternative splicing of select genes is an important mechanism to regulate responses to endogenous and environmental signals in plants. However, the role of alternative splicing in regulating fruit ripening remains unclear. Here, we discovered that MaMYB16L, an R1-type MYB transcription factor, undergoes alternative splicing and generates two transcripts, the full-length isoform MaMYB16L and a truncated form MaMYB16S, in banana fruit. During banana fruit ripening, the alternative splicing process intensifies with downregulated MaMYB16L and upregulated MaMYB16S. Moreover, MaMYB16L is a transcriptional repressor that directly binds with the promoters of many genes associated with starch degradation and MaDREB2, a positive ripening regulator, and represses their expression. In contrast, MaMBY16S lacks a DNA-binding domain but competitively combines and forms non-functional heterodimers with functional MaMYB16L. MaMYB16L-MaMYB16S heterodimers decrease the binding capacity and transrepression activity of MaMYB16L. The downregulation of MaMYB16L and the upregulation of MaMYB16S, that is, a decreased ratio of active to non-active isoforms, facilitates the activation of ripening-related genes and thereby promotes fruit ripening. Furthermore, the transient overexpression of MaMYB16S promotes banana fruit ripening, whereas the overexpression of MaMYB16L delays this process. Therefore, the alternative splicing of MaMYB16L might generate a self-controlled regulatory loop to regulate banana fruit ripening.',\n",

Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is reported to regulate excessive oral keratinocytes apoptosis which compromises oral epithelial barrier in oral lichen planus (OLP). Although many studies have suggested that miR-122 is capable of regulating cell apoptosis, its effects on the development of OLP and VDR expression are still unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that miR-122 expression is increased in the epithelial layer of OLP. Mechanically, transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) selectively binds with κB element in the promoter of miR-122 to accelerate gene transcription. The up-regulation of miR-122 induces cell apoptosis in human oral keratinocytes (HOKs) by targeting VDR mRNA. In VDR knockout oral keratinocytes, miR-122 fails to improve caspase 3 activity and cleaved caspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) levels. Moreover, VDR overexpression is able to reverse lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or activated CD4+ T cell-induced miR-122 up-regulation and ameliorate miR-122-stimulated caspase 3 activity.

The glms gene is greatly conserved in Ralstonia solanacearum species complex (RSSC), while its downstream regions are mostly different in the RSSC. Here, we provided genetic evidence to validate that this Tn7 integration is dependent on a conserved 30-bp motif in the glms, called an attTn7 box, and artificial attTn7 boxes elsewhere are competent for the Tn7 integration, which is further confirmed to be simultaneous downstream of both original and artificial attTn7 boxes, using PCR. With the whole-genome resequencing on 500 Tn7-colonies, the Tn7 integration was confirmed to be site- specific at 25 bp downstream of glms with monocopy as a chromosome of the RSSC. Characteristic of a monocopy in a chromosome enables the Tn7-based complementation to fully restore phenotypes of mutants to those of parent strains that are advantageous rather than those based on plasmids with low-copy numbers. The Tn7-based genomic integration system provides a generally applicable and versatile genetic tool for studies of complementation, pathogenesis, overexpression, and in-vivo promoter activity assays with monocopy in the RSSC.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

       "  'abstract': 'Importance\\nIn patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), overuse of diagnostic imaging is an important point of concern.\\nObjective\\nTo derive and validate a 4-level pretest probability rule (4-Level Pulmonary Embolism Clinical Probability Score [4PEPS]) that makes it possible to rule out PE solely on clinical criteria and optimized D-dimer measurement to safely decrease imaging testing for suspected PE.\\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\\nThis study included consecutive outpatients suspected of having PE from US and European emergency departments. Individual data from 3 merged management studies (n\\u2009=\\u200911\\u202f114; overall prevalence of PE, 11%) were used for the derivation cohort and internal validation cohort. The external validation cohorts were taken from 2 independent studies, the first with a high PE prevalence (n\\u2009=\\u20091548; prevalence, 21.5%) and the second with a moderate PE prevalence (n\\u2009=\\u20091669; prevalence, 11.7%). A prior definition of pretest probability target values to achieve a posttest probability less than 2% was used on the basis of the negative likelihood ratios of D-dimer. Data were collected from January 2003 to April 2016, and data were analyzed from June 2018 to August 2019.\\nMain Outcomes and Measures\\nThe rate of PE diagnosed during the initial workup or during follow-up and the rate of imaging testing.\\nResults\\nOf the 5588 patients in the derivation cohort, 3441 (61.8%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 52 (18.5) years. The 4PEPS comprises 13 clinical variables scored from -2 to 5. It results in the following strategy: (1) very low probability of PE if 4PEPS is less than 0: PE ruled out without testing; (2) low probability of PE if 4PEPS is 0 to 5: PE ruled out if D-dimer level is less than 1.0 μg/mL; (3) moderate probability of PE if 4PEPS is 6 to 12: PE ruled out if D-dimer level is less than the age-adjusted cutoff value; (4) high probability of PE if 4PEPS is greater than 12: PE ruled out by imaging without preceding D-dimer test. In the first and the second external validation cohorts, the area under the receiver operator characteristic curves were 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.82) and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.74 to 0.81), respectively. The false-negative testing rates if the 4PEPS strategy had been applied were 0.71% (95% CI, 0.37 to 1.23) and 0.89% (95% CI, 0.53 to 1.49), respectively. The absolute reductions in imaging testing were -22% (95% CI, -26 to -19) and -19% (95% CI, -22 to -16) in the first and second external validation cohorts, respectively. The 4PEPS strategy compared favorably with all recent strategies in terms of imaging testing.\\nConclusions and Relevance\\nThe 4PEPS strategy may lead to a substantial and safe reduction in imaging testing for patients with suspected PE. It should now be tested in a formal outcome study.',\n",

Participants' eye movements were evaluated with a 12-minute ET procedure, yielding 42 metrics related to smooth pursuit eye movement (SPEM), saccades, dynamic visual acuity, and reaction time. Clinically important discriminator metrics were defined as those with significantly different group differences and area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUROCs) of at least 0.70.\\nResults\\nA total of 34 participants with concussions (mean [SD] age, 19.7 [2.4] years; 20 [63%] men) and 54 participants without concussions (mean [SD] age, 20.8 [2.2] years; 31 [57%] men) completed the study. Six ET metrics (ie, simple reaction time, discriminate reaction time, discriminate visual reaction speed, choice visual reaction speed, and reaction time on 2 measures of dynamic visual acuity 2) were found to be clinically important; all were measures of reaction time, and none were related to SPEM. Combined, these 6 metrics had an AUROC of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.80-0.99), a sensitivity of 77.8%, and a specificity of 92.6%. The 6 metrics remained significant on sensitivity testing.\\nConclusions and Relevance\\nIn this study, ET measures of slowed visual reaction time had high classification accuracy for concussion. Accurate, objective measures of NO function have the potential to improve concussion recognition and reduce the disability associated with underdiagnosis.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The 5-year survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is difficult due to the high recurrence rate and metastasis. Tumor infiltrating immune cells (TICs) and immune-related genes (IRGs) bring hope to improve survival and treatment of HCC patients. However, there are problems in predicting immune signatures and identifying novel therapeutic targets. In the study, the CIBERSORT algorithm was used to evaluate 22 immune cell infiltration patterns in gene expression omnibus (GEO) and the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) data. Eight immune cells were found to have significant infiltration differences between the tumor and normal groups. The CD8+ T cells immune signature was constructed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm. The high infiltration level of CD8+ T cells could significantly improve survival of patients. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) algorithm identified MMP9 was closely related to the overall survival of HCC patients. K-M survival and tROC analysis confirmed that MMP9 had an excellent prognostic prediction. Cox regression showed that a dual immune signature of CD8+ T cells and MMP9 was independent survival factor in HCC. Therefore, a dual prognostic immune signature could improve the survival of patient and may provide a new strategy for the immunotherapy of HCC.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The use of hand-held dental X-ray units is increasing within Australia since their portability is advantageous in applications such as aged care. However, proximity of the operator to the X-ray unit raises radiation safety concerns. The aim of this study was to evaluate operator radiation exposure and methods of dose reduction for the Rextar X camera-style hand-held dental X-ray unit. Leakage and scattered radiation were measured using a solid state detector. Scatter was generated using a Perspex head phantom. Measurements of scattered radiation dose as a function of distance were made with and without a lead acrylic scatter shield (0.6\\xa0mm\\xa0Pb equivalence at 100\\xa0kVp) attached to the X-ray unit. Without the scatter shield, doses to the operator from a single adult maxillary molar X-ray exposure were 0.69, 0.78 and 0.47\\xa0µGy at the left hand, right hand and eyes respectively. With the scatter shield attached, doses were reduced to 0.25, 0.12 and 0.15\\xa0µGy respectively, corresponding to a dose reduction of 64, 85 and 68%. The contribution from leakage radiation was insignificant in comparison. It is highly unlikely that an operator would reach occupational dose limits when using the Rextar X hand-held dental X-ray unit, even without the scatter shield in place. Nevertheless, it is strongly recommended that the scatter shield is attached to keep operator doses as low as reasonably achievable. Use of the scatter shield additionally ensures compliance with the Australian legislative requirement for a protective barrier and is considered a preferable alternative to X-ray protective clothing.',\n",

Although most neurons infrequently emit spikes, a small fraction of neurons exhibit extremely high frequencies of spikes; this fraction of neurons plays a pivotal role in information processing, however, little is known about how these outliers emerge and whether they are maintained over time. In primary cultures of mouse hippocampal neurons, we traced highly active neurons every 24\\u2009h for 7\\u2009wk by optically observing the fluorescent protein dVenus; the expression of dVenus was controlled by the promoter of Arc, an immediate early gene that is induced by neuronal activity. Under default-mode conditions, 0.3%-0.4% of neurons were spontaneously Arc-dVenus positive, exhibiting high firing rates. These neurons were spatially clustered, exhibited intermittently repeated dVenus expression, and often continued to express Arc-dVenus for approximately 2 wk. Thus, highly active neurons constitute a few select functional subpopulations in the neuronal network.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The overdispersion of neuronal activity levels can often be attributed to very few neurons exhibiting extremely high firing rates, but due to technical difficulty, no studies have examined how these outliers are selected during development and whether they are maintained over time.

Furthermore, we show that MSL complex proteins and H4K16ac are not required for cell proliferation and chromatin accessibility, whereas the NSL complex is essential for cell survival, as it stimulates transcription initiation at the promoters of housekeeping genes. In summary, we show that KAT8 switches catalytic activity and function depending on its associated proteins and that, when in the NSL complex, it catalyzes H4K5ac and H4K8ac required for the expression of essential genes.',\n",

We have reported that Ang II could change the DNA methylation status around transcription factor-binding sites and a transcription start site (TSS) and activate expression of CYP11B2. Similar to Ang II, small increases in extracellular potassium levels also increase CYP11B2 mRNA levels.\\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\\nAdrenocortical H295R cells were treated with different doses of potassium. Methylation analysis of CYP11B2 promoter region was done by bisulfite sequencing. CYP11B2 mRNA and protein levels, chromatin accessibility, methylation and demethylation activity were estimated. The transcriptional ability of CYP11B2 promoter with or without methylation was assessed. Potassium stimulation caused DNA demethylation around cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1) and nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A (NR4A) family-binding sites and a TSS; demethylation was accompanied by recruitment of CREB1 and NR4A1 and increased chromatin accessibility of the CYP11B2 promoter.

The key regulators and their interactive network in HCC pathogenesis remain unclear. Along with genetic mutations, aberrant epigenetic paradigms, including deregulated microRNAs (miRNAs), exert profound impacts on hepatocyte transformation and tumor microenvironment remodeling; however, the underlying mechanisms are largely uncharacterized.\\nMETHODS\\nWe performed RNA sequencing on HCC specimens and bioinformatic analyses to identify tumor-associated miRNAs. The miRNA functional targets and their effects on tumor-infiltrating immune cells were investigated. The upstream events, particularly the epigenetic mechanisms responsible for miRNA deregulation in HCC, were explored.\\nRESULTS\\nThe miR-144/miR-451a cluster was downregulated in HCC and predicted a better HCC patient prognosis. These miRNAs promoted macrophage M1 polarization and antitumor activity by targeting hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). The miR-144/miR-451a cluster and EZH2, the catalytic subunit of polycomb repressive complex (PRC2), formed a feedback circuit in which miR-144 targeted EZH2 and PRC2 epigenetically repressed the miRNA genes via histone H3K27 methylation of the promoter. The miRNA cluster was coordinately silenced by distal enhancer hypermethylation, disrupting chromatin loop formation and enhancer-promoter interactions. Clinical examinations indicated that methylation of this chromatin region is a potential HCC biomarker.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nOur study revealed novel mechanisms underlying miR-144/miR-451a cluster deregulation and the crosstalk between malignant cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in HCC, providing new insights into HCC pathogenesis and diagnostic strategies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND\\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an unprecedented disaster for people around the world. Many studies have shown that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are effective in treating COVID-19. However, it is difficult to find the most effective combination herbal pair among numerous herbs, as well as identifying its potential mechanisms. Herbal pair is the main form of a combination of TCM herbs, which is widely used for the treatment of diseases. It can also help us to better understand the compatibility of TCM prescriptions, thus improving the curative effects. The purpose of this article is to explore the compatibility of TCM prescriptions and identify the most important herbal pair for the treatment of COVID-19, and then analyze the active components and potential mechanisms of this herbal pair.\\nMETHODS\\nWe first systematically sorted the TCM prescriptions recommended by the leading experts for treating COVID-19, and the specific herbs contained in these prescriptions across different stages of the disease. Next, the association rule approach was employed to examine the distribution and compatibility among these TCM prescriptions, and then identify the most important herbal pair. On this basis, we further investigated the active ingredients and potential targets in the selected herbal pair by a network pharmacology approach, and analyzed the potential mechanisms against COVID-19. Finally, the main active compounds in the herbal pair were selected for molecular docking with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) 3CLpro and angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) for further verification.\\nRESULT\\nWe obtained 32 association rules for the herbal combinations in the selection of TCM treatment for COVID-19. The results showed that the combination of Amygdalus Communis Vas (ACV) and Ephedra sinica Stapf (ESS) had the highest confidence degree and lift value, as well as high support degree, which can be used in almost all the stages of COVID-19, so ACV and ESS (AE) were selected as the most important herbal pair. There were 26 active ingredients and 44 potential targets, which might be related to the herbal pair of AE against COVID-19. The main active ingredients of AE against COVID-19 were quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, while the potential targets were Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase 1 (MAPK)1, MAPK8, Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) p65 subunit (RELA). The protein-protein interaction (PPI) cluster demonstrated that IL-6 was the seed in the cluster, which plays an important role in connecting other nodes in the PPI network. The potential pathways mainly involved tumor necrosis factor (TNF), Toll-like receptor (TLR), hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLRs). The molecular docking results showed that the main active ingredients of AE have good affinity with SARS-COV-2 3CLpro and ACE2, which are consistent with the above analysis.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThere were 32 association rules in the TCM prescriptions recommended by experts for COVID-19. The combination of ACV and EAS was the most important herbal pair for the treatment of COVID-19. AE might have therapeutic effects against COVID-19 by affecting the inflammatory and immune responses, cell apoptosis, hypoxia damage and other pathological processes through multiple components, targets and pathways.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"BACKGROUND\\nNANOG is a core transcription factor (TF) in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and primordial germ cells (PGCs). Regulation of the NANOG gene by TFs, epigenetic factors, and autoregulatory factors is well characterized in ESCs, and transcriptional regulation of NANOG is well established in these cells. Although NANOG plays a key role in germ cells, the molecular mechanism underlying its transcriptional regulation in PGCs has not been studied. Therefore, we investigated the mechanism that regulates transcription of the chicken NANOG (cNANOG) gene in PGCs and ESCs.\\nRESULTS\\nWe first identified the transcription start site of cNANOG by 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR analysis. Then, we measured the promoter activity of various 5' flanking regions of cNANOG in chicken PGCs and ESCs using the luciferase reporter assay. cNANOG expression required transcriptional regulatory elements, which were positively regulated by POU5F3 (OCT4) and SOX2 and negatively regulated by TP53 in PGCs. The proximal region of the cNANOG promoter contains a positive transcriptional regulatory element (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (CEBP)-binding site) in ESCs. Furthermore, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown demonstrated that POU5F3, SOX2, and CEBP played a role in cell type-specific transcription of cNANOG.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nWe show for the first time that different trans-regulatory elements control transcription of cNANOG in a cell type-specific manner. This finding might help to elucidate the mechanism that regulates cNANOG expression in PGCs and ESCs.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'INTRODUCTION\\nLaser Doppler imaging (LDI) is still not an ubiquitous part of burn care worldwide despite reported accuracy rates of more than 95%, which is significantly higher than clinical assessment alone (50-75%). The aims of Part I of this survey study are: to identify the most important barriers for the use of LDI and to provide useful recommendations for efficient implementation in routine burn care. The actual interpretation and use of LDI measurements is discussed in the Enigma Part II article.\\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\\n1. Informative interviews with 15 representatives of burn centers without LDI. 2. A survey among 51 burn centers with LDI by means of an extensive questionnaire. 3. In-depth interviews with 21 of the participating centers.\\nRESULTS\\n1. All 15 centers without LDI indicated that cost of purchase in combination with maintenance of the LDI device, as well as personnel costs were the reason for not buying, while 12 (80%) also rated the current scientific evidence as insufficient. 2. Twenty-seven burn centers with an LDI (53%) participated and filled in almost the entire questionnaire. In 5 centers, cost delayed the purchase of LDI. The hospital/department paid for the LDI device in 62% of the burn centers and in 88% also for maintenance and salaries. The LDI operators were mainly surgeons (47%) or nurses (42%). In more than half of the burn centers (52%), between 2 and 5 people were trained and certified to use an LDI. In 50% of burn centers, the interpretation of the LDI scan was done by the same person doing the actual measurements. Eighty-nine percent of the burn centers considered the accuracy of the LDI scan as mainly to almost completely accurate. In case of real discrepancy between clinical diagnosis and LDI, in 48% of the burn centers (13/27) the surgeon still relied more on the clinical diagnosis despite reporting this high or almost complete accuracy rate of the LDI.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nBarriers for the routine implementation of LDI were: 1. cost of purchasing and using an LDI combined with health care systems that inadequately reimburse non-surgical management; 2. lack of awareness of or ongoing skepticism towards the scientific evidence supporting LDI use; and 3. organizational constraints combined with logistical limitations. Our recommendations for wider use of LDI technology include: 1. a cost-effective reimbursement of LDI use combined with a more appropriate valuation of expert conservative management compared to surgical therapy; 2. increased use of LDI for every mixed depth burn and; 3. specialized LDI teams to improve burn procedural flexibility and to enable embedding LDI use in the burn care routine. Implementing these measures would promote the highest standards for LDI measurements and interpretation resulting in optimal care with mutual benefits for the hospital, for burn care teams and, most importantly, for the patients.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The anti-human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) antibody assay in common use has changed from the particle agglutination (PA) method to chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) and chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA). These assays were validated in serum but not in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, anti-HTLV-1 antibody positivity in CSF is a requisite for diagnosing HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). We qualitatively compared the assays in CSF from 47 HAM/TSP patients diagnosed using PA, 15 HTLV-1 carriers (HCs), and 18 negative controls. In determining the positivity or negativity of CSF anti-HTLV-1 antibodies, we used serum cutoff points for CLIA and CLEIA because CSF cutoff points had not been decided. Truth table analysis revealed that the performance of CLIA was closer to that of PA and that CLEIA had low sensitivity. CSF antibodies from HAM/TSP patients were all positive by PA and CLIA but 83.0% positive by CLEIA. CSF antibodies from HCs were positive in 73.3%, 80.0%, and 6.7% by PA, CLIA, and CLEIA, respectively. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis for CSF revealed that with the default cutoff point used for serum, CLIA and PA had comparable performances and CLEIA was less sensitive. The best performances of CLIA and CLEIA with adjusted cutoff points were 94.8% sensitivity and 95.5% specificity and 89.7% sensitivity and 95.5% specificity, respectively. We conclude that low-sensitivity CLEIA can underdiagnose HAM/TSP and that CLIA is a better alternative to PA in anti-HTLV-1 antibody assay for CSF with the current cutoff points.',\n",

The bacterium is capable of spore formation, which even allows survival of antibiotic treatment. Although C. difficile features an anaerobic lifestyle, we determined a remarkably high oxygen tolerance of the laboratory reference strain 630Δerm A mutation of a single nucleotide (single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP]) in the DNA sequence (A to G) of the gene encoding the regulatory protein PerR results in an amino acid substitution (Thr to Ala) in one of the helices of the helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain of this transcriptional repressor in C. difficile 630Δerm PerR is a sensor protein for hydrogen peroxide and controls the expression of genes involved in the oxidative stress response. We show that PerR of C. difficile 630Δerm has lost its ability to bind the promoter region of PerR-controlled genes. This results in a constitutive derepression of genes encoding oxidative stress proteins such as a rubrerythrin (rbr1) whose mRNA abundance under anaerobic conditions was increased by a factor of about 7 compared to its parental strain C. difficile 630. Rubrerythrin repression in strain 630Δerm could be restored by the introduction of PerR from strain 630. The permanent oxidative stress response of C. difficile 630Δerm observed here should be considered in physiological and pathophysiological investigations based on this widely used model strain.IMPORTANCE The intestinal pathogen Clostridioides difficile is one of the major challenges in medical facilities nowadays. In order to better combat the bacterium, detailed knowledge of its physiology is mandatory. C. difficile strain 630Δerm was generated in a laboratory from the patient-isolated strain C. difficile 630 and represents a reference strain for many researchers in the field, serving as the basis for the construction of insertional gene knockout mutants. In our work, we demonstrate that this strain is characterized by an uncontrolled oxidative stress response as a result of a single-base-pair substitution in the sequence of a transcriptional regulator. C. difficile researchers working with model strain 630Δerm should be aware of this permanent stress response.',\n",

Together with other core and effector proteins, the PCP pathway controls polarized cell movements. Fuz was also reported as a negative regulator of cell survival. In this study, we performed a pan-cancer survey to demonstrate the role of Fuz in multiple types of cancer. In head-neck squamous cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma tumor samples, a reduction of Fuz transcript expression was detected. This coincides with the poor overall survival probabilities of these patients. We further showed that Fuz promoter hypermethylation contributes to its transcriptional downregulation. Meanwhile, we also identified a relatively higher mutation frequency at the 404th arginine amino acid residue in the coding sequence of Fuz locus, and further demonstrated that mutant Fuz proteins perturb the pro-apoptotic function of Fuz. In summary, our study unveiled an intriguing relationship between Fuz dysregulation and cancer prognosis, and further provides mechanistic insights of Fuz's involvement in carcinogenesis.\",\n",

Here, we describe a unified framework that addresses these needs and is scalable to thousands of samples. Using simulations and data from GTEx, we demonstrate its calibration and performance. For example, mixQTL shows a power gain equivalent to a 29% increase in sample size for genes with sufficient allele-specific read coverage.

This study aims to investigate distributions of GSTA1 promoter haplotypes across different human populations and to assess their impact on the expression of GSTA1. PHASE 2.1.1 was used to infer haplotypes and diplotypes of six GSTA1 promoter SNPs on 2501 individuals from 26 populations classified by the 1000 Genomes Project into five super-populations that included Africa (N\\u2009=\\u2009660), America (N\\u2009=\\u2009347), East Asia (N\\u2009=\\u2009504), Europe (N\\u2009=\\u2009502), and South Asia (N\\u2009=\\u2009488).

The distributions of GSTA1 promoter haplotypes and diplotypes were significantly different among the different human populations. Three new promoter haplotypes were found in the African super-population. LRA demonstrated that SNPs at -52 and -69 has the most impact on GSTA1 expression, however other SNPs have a significant impact on transcriptional activity. Based on LRA, a new model of cis-elements interaction is presented.

However, HDAC inhibitors are much more effective in combination with other anti-cancer agents. To identify novel compounds which act synergistically with HDAC inhibitor, such as suberanoyl hydroxamic acid (SAHA), we performed a cell-based, high-throughput drug screen of 10,560 small molecule compounds from a drug-like diversity library and identified a small molecule compound (SE486-11) which synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic effects of SAHA. Effects of drug combinations on cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis and colony forming were assessed in a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines. Treatment with SAHA and SE486-11 increased MYCN ubiquitination and degradation, and markedly inhibited tumorigenesis in neuroblastoma xenografts, and, MYCN transgenic zebrafish and mice. The combination reduced ubiquitin-specific protease 5 (USP5) levels and increased unanchored polyubiquitin chains. Overexpression of USP5 rescued neuroblastoma cells from the cytopathic effects of the combination and reduced unanchored polyubiquitin, suggesting USP5 is a therapeutic target of the combination. SAHA and SE486-11 directly bound to USP5 and the drug combination exhibited a 100-fold higher binding to USP5 than individual drugs alone in microscale thermophoresis assays. MYCN bound to the USP5 promoter and induced USP5 gene expression suggesting that USP5 and MYCN expression created a forward positive feedback loop in neuroblastoma cells. Thus, USP5 acts as an oncogenic cofactor with MYCN in neuroblastoma and the novel combination of HDAC inhibitor with SE486-11 represents a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the predominant subtype of esophageal cancer with a particularly high prevalence in certain geographical regions and a poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of 15-25%. Despite numerous studies characterizing the genetic and transcriptomic landscape of ESCC, there are currently no effective targeted therapies. In this study, we used an unbiased screening approach to uncover novel molecular precision oncology targets for ESCC and identified the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family member bromodomain testis-specific protein (BRDT) to be uniquely expressed in a subgroup of ESCC. Experimental studies revealed that BRDT expression promotes migration but is dispensable for cell proliferation. Further mechanistic insight was gained through transcriptome analyses, which revealed that BRDT controls the expression of a subset of ΔNp63 target genes. Epigenome and genome-wide occupancy studies, combined with genome-wide chromatin interaction studies, revealed that BRDT colocalizes and interacts with ΔNp63 to drive a unique transcriptional program and modulate cell phenotype. Our data demonstrate that these genomic regions are enriched for super-enhancers that loop to critical ΔNp63 target genes related to the squamous phenotype such as KRT14, FAT2, and PTHLH. Interestingly, BET proteolysis-targeting chimera, MZ1, reversed the activation of these genes. Importantly, we observed a preferential degradation of BRDT by MZ1 compared with BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4. Taken together, these findings reveal a previously unknown function of BRDT in ESCC and provide a proof-of-concept that BRDT may represent a novel therapeutic target in cancer.',\n",

Short (S) forms of this repeat result in reduced transcription, and presumably greater synaptic levels of serotonin, which are involved in opioid and cocaine-induced reward. Dual exposure to heroin and cocaine is a common pattern of poly-drug use and is associated with considerable morbidity. We hypothesize that SLC6A4 variants are associated with cocaine exposure in subjects with an opioid dependence diagnosis (OD), and also in non-dependent opioid users (NOD). Other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of SLC6A4 may also be likewise associated.\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\nThis study determined whether variants of the SLC6A4 promoter repeats and two intronic SNPs, rs16965628 and rs2066713, are associated with categorical diagnoses of opioid dependence (DSM-IV criteria) and with dimensional aspects of cocaine use, in a Caucasian cohort (n=591). Three groups of subjects were examined: (1) 276 subjects with opioid dependence diagnosis (OD); (2) 163 subjects who had used opioids for non-medical reasons but never had an opioid dependence diagnosis (NOD); (3) 152 healthy controls (HC).\\nRESULTS\\nAside from high exposure to heroin in the OD group, relatively high exposure to cocaine was detected in both OD and NOD groups. The SERT repeat genotype (classified as \"long-long\" [LL] versus \"short-long\" plus \"short-short\" [SL+SS]) was not associated with categorical opioid dependence diagnoses.

The [SL+SS] genotype was associated with more rapid cocaine escalation than the LL genotype. No signiﬁcant associations of rs16965628 and rs2066713 SNPs were found overall.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe functional SERT promoter tandem repeat genotype may be associated to heavy cocaine exposure and more rapid escalation of cocaine use, in persons with and without opioid dependence diagnosis.',\n",

Ad5SVP-mPreS2 had a protective effect on hepatic function in a DEN-induced liver injury model because of lower serum levels of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase. Additionally, HBV transgenic mice treated with Ad5SVP-mPreS2 had fewer and smaller cancerous nodes after induction with DEN than untreated mice.\\nCONCLUSION\\nConditionally replicating adenovirus-mediated mPreS2 expression inhibited HBV infection and had an inhibitory effect on liver injury and hepatocellular carcinogenesis in HBV transgenic mice.',\n",

To ascertain students\\' motivation to undertake research, they were asked an open-ended question to describe the single major factor that would encourage them to get involved in research as a medical student. A framework of self-determination theory was used to deductively code the responses as intrinsic motivation (\"IM\"; e.g., interest/passion) or extrinsic motivation (\"EM\"; e.g. improving CV). The two groups were then contrasted in relation to their research engagement.\\nRESULTS\\nA total of 348 students were included in the survey, of whom 204 were coded as IM responses, and 144 were coded as EM responses. Students who engaged in extra-curricular research activities were more likely to report an underlying EM (48% vs 36%, p = 0.03). They were also older (23.7 ± 3.5 vs 21.9 ± 3.7, p = 0.005), and more likely to have completed a prior research degree (15% vs 3%, p = 0.01).\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn this study, EM was a bigger influencer on research involvement by medical students than IM.

PEA3 subfamily of ETS transcription factors (ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5) are upregulated in multiple cancers including colon cancers. However, the underlying epigenetic mechanism regulating their overexpression as well as their role in predicting therapy response in colon cancer are largely unexplored. In this study, using gene expression and methylation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, we showed that promoter DNA methylation negatively correlates with ETV4 expression (ρ = -0.17, p = 5.6 × 10-3) and positively correlates with ETV5 expression (ρ = 0.22, p = 1.43 × 10-4) in colon cancer tissue. Further, our analysis in 1,482 colon cancer patients from five different cohorts revealed that higher ETV5 expression associates with shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) of adjCTX treated colon cancer patients (Hazard ratio = 2.09-5.43, p = 0.004-0.01). The present study suggests ETV5 expression as a strong predictive biomarker for 5-FU-based adjCTX response in stage II/III CC patients.',\n",

In this study, the QSG-7701, a human normal liver cell line, was cultured in different FA levels (High, Normal or No) for 6 months. Then, the biological characteristics, the expression of main stem cell-like genes or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related genes and the tumorigenicity in vivo of cells cultured in different treatment groups were detected. Our results showed that No FA improved the malignant transformation of cells but High FA depressed the malignant transformation. Meanwhile, cells in different treatment groups were mapped by transcriptome sequencing. Then the relativity of increased LCN2 and decreased FA level was identified and confirmed in vitro and vivo. We also revealed that intracellular control of LCN2 would recover the effects of FA on cell proliferation, cell cycle and tumor formation in vitro and vivo. Finally, our studies displayed that increased FA level induced the down-regulation of LCN2 not by DNA hypermethylation of LCN2 promoter but by promoting the level of histone H3 lysine 9 di-methylation (H3K9Me2) in LCN2 promoter. In conclusion, our studies disclosed the chemopreventive effect of FA supplementation on hepatocarcinogenesis, which partial attributed to the inhibition of LCN2 by regulating histone methylation in promoter.

       "  'abstract': 'In fishes, swimming performance is considered an important metric to measure fitness, dispersal and migratory abilities. The swimming performance of individual larval fishes is often integrated into models to make inferences on how environmental parameters affect population-level dynamics (e.g. connectivity). However, little information exists regarding how experimental protocols affect the swimming performance of marine fish larvae. In addition, the technical setups used to measure larval fish swimming performance often lack automation and accurate control of water quality parameters and flow velocity. In this study, we automated the control of multi-lane swimming chambers for small fishes by developing an open-source algorithm. This automation allowed us to execute repeatable flow scenarios and reduce operator interference and inaccuracies in flow velocity typically associated with manual control. Furthermore, we made structural modifications to a prior design to reduce the areas of lower flow velocity. We then validated the flow dynamics of the new chambers using computational fluid dynamics and particle-tracking software. The algorithm provided an accurate alignment between the set and measured flow velocities and we used it to test whether faster critical swimming speed (U crit) protocols (i.e. shorter time intervals and higher velocity increments) would increase U crit of early life stages of two tropical fish species [4-10-mm standard length (SL)]. The U crit of barramundi (Lates calcarifer) and cinnamon anemonefish (Amphiprion melanopus) increased linearly with fish length, but in cinnamon anemonefish, U crit started to decrease upon metamorphosis. Swimming protocols using longer time intervals (more than 2.5 times increase) negatively affected U crit in cinnamon anemonefish but not in barramundi. These species-specific differences in swimming performance highlight the importance of testing suitable U crit protocols prior to experimentation. The automated control of flow velocity will create more accurate and repeatable data on swimming performance of larval fishes. Integrating refined measurements into individual-based models will support future research on the effects of environmental change.',\n",

An increasing body of evidence has revealed a strong correlation between aberrant DNA methylation and tumorigenesis in MIBC.\\nRESULTS\\nUsing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) molecular data for 413 patients, we described a DNA methylation-based signature as a prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) in MIBC patients. By using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model, differentially methylated regions were first identified using multiple criteria followed by survival and LASSO analyses to identify DNA methylation probes related to OS and build a classifier to stratify patients with MIBC. The prognostic value of the classifier, referred to as risk score (RS), was validated in a held-out testing set from the TCGA MIBC cohort. Finally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to compare the prognostic accuracy of the models built with RS alone, RS plus clinicopathologic features, and clinicopathologic features alone. We found that our seven-probe classifier-based RS stratifies patients into high- and low-risk groups for overall survival (OS) in the testing set (n\\xa0= 137) (AUC at 3 years, 0.65; AUC at 5 years, 0.65).

A 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends assay was performed to detect gene transcription initiation sites. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was used to verify the binding of transcription factors and promoter regions. A double luciferase reporter gene vector was constructed to demonstrate the regulatory effect of miR-203a on target genes. Real-time PCR and western blotting were used to detect the relative expression levels of genes and proteins, respectively. The results showed that there was a binding site for the transcription factor EGR1 in the upstream promoter region of miR-203a. WT1, BMI1, and XIAP were identified as target genes regulated by miR-203a. EGR1 and miR-203a were downregulated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the CML K562 cell line, while WT1, BMI1, and XIAP were upregulated. The transcription initiation site of miR-203a was identified in the upstream promoter region (G nucleotide at -339 bp), and the transcription factor EGR1 could bind to the promoter region (at -268 bp) of miR-203a and increase its expression. Over expression of miR-203a inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells. A rescue assay showed that overexpression of WT1, BMI1, and XIAP offset the antitumor effect of miR-203a. Conclusion, EGR1 positively regulated the expression of miR-203a, thus relieving the inhibition of miR-203a on the translation of its target genes (WT1, BMI1, and XIAP) and affecting the proliferation of K562 cells.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Endometrium is the uterine lining that undergoes hundreds of cycles of proliferation, differentiation, and desquamation throughout a woman\\'s reproductive life. Recently, much attention is paid to the appropriate endometrial functioning, as decreased endometrial receptivity is stated to be one of the concerns heavily influencing successes of embryo implantation rates and the efficacy of in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. In order to acquire and maintain the desired endometrial receptivity during IVF cycles, luteal phase support by various progestagens or other hormonal combinations is generally recommended. However, today, the selection of the specific hormonal therapy during IVF seems to be empirical, mainly due to a lack of appropriate tools for personalized approach. Here, we designed the genetic tool for patient-specific optimization of hormonal supplementation schemes required for the maintenance of endometrial receptivity during luteal phase. We optimized and characterized in vitro endometrial stromal cell (ESC) decidualization model as the adequate physiological reflection of endometrial sensitivity to steroid hormones. Based on the whole transcriptome RNA sequencing and the corresponding bioinformatics, we proposed that activation of the decidual prolactin (PRL) promoter containing ancient transposons MER20 and MER39 may reflect functioning of the core decidual regulatory network. Furthermore, we cloned the sequence of decidual PRL promoter containing MER20 and part of MER39 into the expression vector to estimate the effectiveness of ESC decidual response and verified sensitivity of the designed system. We additionally confirmed specificity of the generated tool using human diploid fibroblasts and adipose-derived human mesenchymal stem cells. Finally, we demonstrated the possibility to apply our tool for personalized hormone screening by comparing the effects of natural progesterone and three synthetic analogs (medroxyprogesterone 17-acetate, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate, dydrogesterone) on decidualization of six ESC lines obtained from patients planning to undergo the IVF procedure. To sum up, we developed the \"all-in-one\" genetic tool based on the MER20/MER39 expression cassette that provides the ability to predict the most appropriate hormonal cocktail for endometrial receptivity maintenance specifically and safely for the patient, and thus to define the personal treatment strategy prior to the IVF procedure.',\n",

Candidate signaling pathway activation was examined. As expected, LVH observed in NTL mice with AngII infusion was attenuated in heterozygous (GqI+/-) mice and absent in homozygous (GqI-/-) mice. In contrast, LVH due to TAC was unaltered by either heterozygous or homozygous Gq inhibition. Gene expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and α-skeletal actin (α-SA) was increased 48 h after AngII infusion or TAC in NTL mice; in GqI mice, the increases in ANP, BNP and α-SA in response to AngII were completely absent, as expected, but all three increased after TAC. Increased nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells c4 (NFATc4), indicating calcineurin pathway activation, occurred in NTL mice with AngII infusion but not TAC, and was prevented in GqI mice infused with AngII. Nuclear and cytoplasmic CaMKIIδ levels increased in both NTL and GqI mice after TAC but not AngII infusion, with increased cytoplasmic phospho- and total histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) and increased nuclear myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) levels.\\nCONCLUSION\\nCardiac Gq receptors and calcineurin activation are required for neurohumorally mediated LVH but not for LVH induced by mechanical pressure overload (TAC).

       "  'abstract': 'Investigation of bacterial gene regulation upon environmental changes is still a challenging task. For example, Vibrio cholerae, a pathogen of the human gastrointestinal tract, faces diverse transient conditions in different compartments upon oral ingestion. Genetic reporter systems have been demonstrated to be extremely powerful tools to unravel gene regulation events in complex conditions, but so far focused mainly on gene induction. Herein, we describe the TetR-controlled recombination-based in vivo expression technology TRIVET, which allows detection of gene silencing events. TRIVET resembles a modified variant of the in vivo expression technology (IVET) as well as recombination-based in vivo expression technology (RIVET), which were used to identify conditional gene induction in several bacteria during host colonization. Like its predecessors, TRIVET is a single cell based reporter system, which allows the analysis of bacterial gene repression in a spatiotemporal manner via phenotypical changes in the resistance profile. Briefly, a promoterless tetR (encoding the transcriptional repressor TetR) can be integrated randomly into the bacterial genome via transposon mutagenesis or site-specific downstream of a promoter of interest via homologous recombination. Reduction of transcriptional expression of TetR results in a de-repression of the TetR-controlled resolvase TnpR, which in turn leads to excision of an antibiotic resistance cassette (also known as res-cassette) and altered resistance profile observable via streaking on ampicillin and kanamycin plates. This alteration can then be quantified as the ratio between resistant and non-resistant isolates. Furthermore, the newly introduced second reporter gene, a promoterless phoA (encoding the alkaline phosphatase PhoA) offers an additional validation step of the results via an independent colorimetric assay to measure enzyme activity. The protocol presented herein also offers an approach to identify the gene locus in case of the random screen for gene repression as well as a quantification of the conditional repression of a gene of interest. Although the current protocol is established for gene repression during host colonization, it can likely be adapted to study gene silencing under various conditions faced by a bacterium.',\n",

Neurons are especially sensitive to the harmful effects of excess mROS while astrocytic mROS have been shown to play a relevant physiological role in cerebral homeostasis and behaviour. However, given the complexity of the brain, investigating mROS formation in a specific cell-type in adult animals is methodologically challenging.

Whereas their status for commercial use is undetermined, the search for alternative stains for expression of recombinant protein continues. Strains of other species of methylotrophic yeasts have been adapted, among which the genus Ogataea representatives prevail. Despite the phylogenetic gap between the genus Ogataea and the genus Komagataella representatives, it turned out possible to use classic vectors and promoters for expression of recombinant protein in all cases. There exist expression systems based on other strains of the genus Komagataella as well as the genus Candida. The potential of these microorganisms for genetic engineering is far from exhausted. Both improvement of existing expression systems and development of new ones on the basis of strains obtained from nature are advantageous. Historically, strains obtained on the southwest of the USA were used as expression systems up to 2009. Currently, expression systems based on strains obtained in Thailand are gaining popularity. Since this group of microorganisms is widely represented around the world both in nature and in urban environments, it may reasonably be expected that new expression systems for recombinant proteins based on strains obtained in other regions of the globe will appear.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The causative agent of opisthorchiasis, the liver fluke Opisthorchis felineus (Rivolta, 1884) is one of the helminths of humans and animals in Russia. Together with closely related species of trematodes O. viverrini (Poirier, 1886) and Clonorchis sinensis (Loos, 1907), O. felineus is a part of a triad of epidemiologically important trematodes in the family Opisthorchiidae. Adult O. felineus worms infest the hepatobiliary system of warm-blooded animals and might provoke the development of severe pathologies, including malignancy of bile duct epithelium. The high medical importance of O. felineus attracts the attention of researchers. This review briefly summarizes the data about O. felineus genomics and proteomics. The review provides a comparative analysis of the number of genes and sizes of nuclear genomes of a number of flatworms, the distribution of intron lengths, as well as results of synteny between the O. felineus, O. viverrini and C. sinensis genomes. Special attention is paid to a particular form of RNA processing known as trans-splicing, widely presented in the opisthorchiid genomes. We also provide the results of a comparative analysis of the xenobiotic metabolizing system between parasitic and free-living flatworms. Moreover, data on parasitic granulins, which are potential promoters of cholangiocyte neoplasia, are also presented. Data on the O. felineus genomics and proteomics provide first insights into the structural and functional organization of the genome of this parasitic flatworm with a complex life cycle as well as provide a significant contribution to our understanding of \"host-parasite\" interaction and evolution of this group of parasitic flatworms.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND & AIMS\\nMacrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an inflammatory cytokine and an important regulator of innate immune responses. We hypothesised that serum concentrations of MIF are associated with disease severity and outcome in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF).\\nMETHODS\\nCirculating concentrations of MIF and its soluble receptor CD74 (sCD74) were determined in sera from 292 patients with acute decompensation of cirrhosis defined as new onset or worsening of ascites requiring hospitalisation. Of those, 78 (27%) had ACLF. Short-term mortality was assessed 90 days after inclusion.\\nRESULTS\\nAlthough serum concentrations of MIF and sCD74 did not correlate with liver function parameters or ACLF, higher MIF (optimum cut-off >2.3 ng/ml) and lower concentrations of sCD74 (optimum cut-off <66.5 ng/ml) both indicated poorer 90-day transplant-free survival in univariate analyses (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.01 [1.26-3.22]; p\\xa0= 0.004 for MIF; HR 0.59 [0.38-0.92]; p\\xa0= 0.02 for sCD74) and after adjustment in multivariable models. Higher MIF concentrations correlated with surrogates of systemic inflammation (white blood cells, p\\xa0= 0.005; C-reactive protein, p\\xa0= 0.05) and were independent of genetic MIF promoter polymorphisms. Assessment of MIF plasma concentrations in portal venous blood and matched blood samples from the right atrium in a second cohort of patients undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt insertion revealed a transhepatic MIF gradient with higher concentrations in the right atrial blood.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nSerum concentrations of MIF and its soluble receptor CD74 predict 90-day transplant-free survival in patients with acute decompensation of cirrhosis. This effect was independent of liver function and genetic predispositions, but rather reflected systemic inflammation. Therefore, MIF and sCD74 represent promising prognostic markers beyond classical scoring systems in patients at risk of ACLF.\\nLAY SUMMARY\\nInflammatory processes contribute to the increased risk of death in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. We show that patients with high serum levels of the inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) alongside low levels of its binding receptor sCD74 in blood indicate an increased mortality risk in patients with ascites. The cirrhotic liver is a relevant source of elevated circulating MIF levels.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"More than 50 years after the identification of RNA polymerase II, the enzyme responsible for the transcription of most eukaryotic genes, studies have continued to reveal fresh aspects of its structure and regulation. New technologies, coupled with years of development of a vast catalog of RNA polymerase II accessory proteins and activities, have led to new revelations about the transcription process. The maturation of cryo-electron microscopy as a tool for unraveling the detailed structure of large molecular machines has provided numerous structures of the enzyme and its accessory factors. Advances in biophysical methods have enabled the observation of a single polymerase's behavior, distinct from work on aggregate population averages. Other recent work has revealed new properties and activities of the general initiation factors that RNA polymerase II employs to accurately initiate transcription, as well as chromatin proteins that control RNA polymerase II's firing frequency, and elongation factors that facilitate the enzyme's departure from the promoter and which control sequential steps and obstacles that must be navigated by elongating RNA polymerase II. There has also been a growing appreciation of the physical properties conferred upon many of these proteins by regions of each polypeptide that are of low primary sequence complexity and that are often intrinsically disordered. This peculiar feature of a surprisingly large number of proteins enables a disordered region of the protein to morph into a stable structure and creates an opportunity for pathway participants to dynamically partition into subcompartments of the nucleus. These subcompartments host designated portions of the chemical reactions that lead to mRNA synthesis. This article highlights a selection of recent findings that reveal some of the resolved workings of RNA polymerase II and its ensemble of supporting factors.\",\n",

In recent times, nanotechnology is considered as a promising and emerging approach to be incorporated in agriculture to improve productivity of different crops by the administration of nanoparticles through seed treatment, foliar spray on plants, nano-fertilizers for balanced crop nutrition, nano-herbicides for effective weed control, nanoinsecticides for plant protection, early detection of plant diseases and nutrient deficiencies using diagnostics kits, and nano-pheromones for effective monitoring of pests. Further, distinct nanoparticles with unique physicochemical and biological properties are used in agriculture to increase the percentage of seed germination, which is the initial step to increase the crop yield. In the context of agricultural crops, nanoparticles have both positive effects on seed quality parameters, such as germination percentage, seedling length, seedling dry weight and vigor indices, as well as negative impacts of causing toxicity toward the environment. Thus, the aim of this review article is to provide a comprehensive overview on the effects of super-dispersive metal powders, such as zinc, silver, and titanium nanoparticles on the seed quality parameters of different crops. In addition, the drawback of conventional seed growth enhancers, impact of metal nanoparticles toward seeds, and mechanism of nanoparticles to increase seed germination were also discussed.',\n",

The objective of this study was to develop a novel method to rapidly clone the full-length cDNA of a very virulent NDV by only one assembly step. A completely synthetic 15\\xa0kb cDNA of a Malaysian genotype VIII NDV known as strain AF2240-I with additional flanking BsmBI sites was synthesised. However, to completely follow the rule-of-six, the additional G residues that are traditionally added after the T7 promoter transcription initiation site were not synthesised.

The construct was co-transfected with helper plasmids into BSRT7/5 cells. A recombinant NDV called rAF was successfully rescued using transfection supernatant harvested as early as 16\\xa0h post-transfection. Virus from each passage showed an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) and a mean death time (MDT) similar to the parent strain AF2240-I.

       "  'abstract': 'Rice tungro disease (RTD) is a devastating disease of rice caused by combined infection with rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) and rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV), with one of the main symptoms being stunting. To dissect the molecular events responsible for RTD-induced stunting, the expression patterns of 23 cell-wall-related genes were examined in different rice lines with the same titers of RTSV but different titers of RTBV and in lines where only RTBV was present. Genes encoding cellulose synthases, expansins, glycosyl hydrolases, exostosins, and xyloglucan galactosyl transferase showed downregulation, whereas those encoding defensin or defensin-like proteins showed upregulation with increasing titers of RTBV. RTSV titers did not affect the expression levels of these genes. A similar relationship was seen for the reduction in the cellulose and pectin content and the accumulation of lignin. In silico analysis of promoters of the genes indicated a possible link to transcription factors reported earlier to respond to viral titers in rice. These results suggest a common network in which the genes related to the cell wall components are affected during infection with diverse viruses in rice.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"It is well established that mRNA steady-state levels do not directly correlate with transcription rate. This is attributed to the multiple post-transcriptional mechanisms, which control both mRNA turnover and translation within eukaryotic cells. One such mechanism is the removal of the 5' end cap structure of RNAs (decapping). This 5' cap plays a fundamental role in cellular functions related to mRNA processing, transport, translation, quality control, and decay, while its chemical modifications influence the fate of cytoplasmic mRNAs. Decapping is a highly controlled process, performed by multiple decapping enzymes, and regulated by complex cellular networks. In this review, we provide an updated synopsis of 5' end modifications and functions, and give an overview of mRNA decapping enzymes, presenting their enzymatic properties. Focusing on DCP2 decapping enzyme, a major component on the 5'-3' mRNA decay pathway, we describe cis-elements and trans-acting factors that affect its activity, substrate specificity, and cellular localization.

Among the E. chaffeensis P28-OMP outer membrane proteins, OMP-1B and P28 are predominantly expressed in tick cells and mammalian macrophages, respectively. The mechanisms regulating this differential expression have not been comprehensively studied. Here, we demonstrate that the transcriptional regulators EcxR and Tr1 regulate the differential expression of omp-1B and p28 in E. chaffeensis. Recombinant E. chaffeensis Tr1 bound to the promoters of omp-1B and p28, and transactivated omp-1B and p28 promoter-EGFP fusion constructs in Escherichia coli. The consensus sequence of Tr1 binding motifs was AC/TTATA as determined with DNase I footprint assay. Tr1 showed a higher affinity towards the p28 promoter than the omp-1B promoter as determined with surface plasmon resonance. EcxR activated the tr1 expression in response to a temperature decrease. At 37°C low level of Tr1 activated the p28 expression. At 25°C high level of Tr1 activated the omp-1B expression, while repressing the p28 expression by binding to an additional site upstream of the p28 gene.

In Arabidopsis, a clade of four RanBP2 Znf-containing proteins, named the Organelle Zinc (OZ) finger family, are known or predicted to be targeted to either the mitochondria or the plastids. Previously we reported that OZ1 is absolutely required for the editing of 14 sites in chloroplasts. We now have investigated the function of OZ2, whose null mutation is embryo lethal. We rescued the null mutant by expressing wild-type OZ2 under the control of the seed-specific ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3) promoter. Rescued mutant plants exhibit severely delayed development and a distinctive morphological phenotype. Genetic and biochemical analyses demonstrated that OZ2 promotes the splicing of transcripts of several mitochondrial nad genes and rps3. The splicing defect of nad transcripts results in the destabilization of complex I, which in turn affects the respiratory ability of oz2 mutants, turning on the alternative respiratory pathway, and impacting the plant development. Protein-protein interaction assays demonstrated binding of OZ2 to several known mitochondrial splicing factors targeting the same splicing events.

A single trypanosome has >2000 VSG genes and pseudogenes of which only one is expressed from one of ∼15 telomeric bloodstream form expression sites (BESs). Infectious metacyclic trypanosomes present within the tsetse fly vector also express VSG from a separate set of telomeric metacyclic ESs (MESs). All MESs are silenced in bloodstream form T. brucei. As very little is known about how this is mediated, we performed a whole genome RNAi library screen to identify MES repressors. This allowed us to identify a novel SAP domain containing DNA binding protein which we called TbSAP. TbSAP is enriched at the nuclear periphery and binds both MESs and BESs. Knockdown of TbSAP in bloodstream form trypanosomes did not result in cells becoming more 'metacyclic-like'. Instead, there was extensive global upregulation of transcripts including MES VSGs, VSGs within the silent VSG arrays as well as genes immediately downstream of BES promoters. TbSAP therefore appears to be a novel chromatin protein playing an important role in silencing the extensive VSG repertoire of bloodstream form T. brucei.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Reconstruction of bone defects and compensation of deficient repair mechanisms represent important goals within the field of regenerative medicine and require novel safe strategies for translation into the clinic. A non-viral osteogenic gene therapeutic vector system ('hybrid vectors') was generated, combining an improved bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) gene cassette and single pro-osteogenic microRNAs (miR-148b-3p, miR-20-5p, miR-590b-5p), driven by the U6 promoter. The vectors were tested in vitro for their osteogenic differentiation potential in C2C12 and C3H/10T1/2 cell lines, using BMP2 alone as control. After confirming BMP2 expression and miRNA transcription, increased osteogenic differentiation was observed by all hybrid vectors, but most consistently by BMP2/miR-590-5p, using alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity assays and osteogenic marker mRNA quantitation, including runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), collagen type 1 (Col1a1) and osteocalcin. To visualise target mRNAs of the respective miRNAs, next generation sequencing was performed, confirming down-regulation of mRNA targets of the hybrid vectors. Since the hybrid vector consisting of BMP2 and miR-590-5p showed the largest increase in osteogenic differentiation in vitro, this was tested in a mouse ectopic-bone model. Mineralisation was more than with BMP2 alone. The present study showed hybrid vectors as a novel non-viral gene therapeutic plasmid system for combining therapeutic effects of recombinant protein expression and miRNA transcription that did not add to the burden of the translation machinery, while improving the therapeutic efficacies. In vivo proof-of-principle in the context of bone regeneration suggested that such hybrid vectors will be applicable in a wide array of gene therapeutic strategies.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'OBJECTIVE\\nDue to the decrease of estrogen and estrogen receptor (ER) in postmenopausal women, they have a higher risk of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) than men. This study aims to explore how ERα and ERb interact with CCN5 and protect IDD.\\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\\nWe used Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Luciferase reporter assay to determine whether the ERα/b protein binds to CCN5 promoter and activates its expression. We used TNF-α to induce nucleus pulposus (NP) cell degeneration to simulate the IDD process. The change of the expression of ERα/β and CCN5 was measured in the degenerated NP cells. To understand the function of ERα/β in the NP cells degeneration, we upregulated the ERα/b gene expression by vector transfection or 17b-estradiol (E2) stimulation. Besides, we also used the CCN5 gene-silenced NP cells by siRNA transfection as a comparison to determine the role of CCN5. We tested the cell proliferation and principal components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) to value the degree of NP cell degeneration.\\nRESULTS\\nERα and ERβ protein can bind to the same promoter regions of CCN5 and activate its expression, respectively. TNF-α degraded NP cells with a reduction of cell proliferation, collagen II, ACAN, ERα, ERβ, and CCN5 expression, and increased collagen I/III, and MMP-13 expression. Upregulated ERα or ERβ resulted in the maintains of CCN5 and alleviated the NP cell degeneration. Besides, 17β-E2 supplement increased the ERα, ERβ, and CCN5 expression, as well as stable NP cells phenotype. However, it was partly abolished by the silencing of CCN5.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nUpregulation of ERα and ERβ protects the NP cell degeneration during IDD through the activation of CCN5 by binding to its promoter.',\n",

Potential binding sites in the promoter sequences of TUG1 and SP1 were predicted using the JASPAR. Their interaction was further confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Dual-Luciferase reporter assay. The influences of TUG1 on proliferative and apoptotic potentials in Min6 cells were examined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Subsequently, the interaction in the TUG1/miR-188-3p /FGF5 axis was similarly explored by Dual-Luciferase reporter assay.\\nRESULTS\\nSP1 and TUG1 were downregulated in high-fat and high-glucose models, and they displayed a positive correlation. TUG1 bound E2 region in SP1 promoters. Knockdown of TUG1 inhibited proliferative rate and induced apoptosis in high-glucose-treated Min6 cells. Furthermore, the TUG1 / miR-188-3p /FGF5 axis was identified to be responsible for regulating Min6 cell functions.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nSP1 induces TUG1 downregulation in T2DM cell models, which further regulates proliferative and apoptotic potentials in islet cells by activating the miR-188-3p/FGF5 axis.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"BACKGROUND\\nPrevious genetic pest management (GPM) systems in diamondback moth (DBM) have relied on expressing lethal proteins ('effectors') that are 'cell-autonomous', that is, they do not leave the cell in which they are expressed. To increase the flexibility of future GPM systems in DBM, we aimed to assess the use of a non-cell-autonomous, invertebrate-specific, neurotoxic effector - the scorpion toxin AaHIT. This AaHIT effector was designed to be secreted by expressing cells, potentially leading to effects on distant cells, specifically neuromuscular junctions.\\nRESULTS\\nExpression of AaHIT caused a 'shaking/quivering' phenotype that could be repressed by provision of an antidote (tetracycline): a phenotype consistent with the AaHIT mode-of-action. This effect was more pronounced when AaHIT expression was driven by the Hr5/ie1 promoter (82.44% of males, 65.14% of females) rather than Op/ie2 (57.35% of males, 48.39% of females). Contrary to expectations, the shaking phenotype and observed fitness costs were limited to adults in which they caused severe reductions in mean longevity (-81%) and median female fecundity (-93%). Quantitative polymerase chain reactions of AaHIT expression patterns and analysis of piggyBac-mediated transgene insertion sites suggest that restriction of the observed effects to the adult stages may be due to the influence of the local genomic environment on the tetO-AaHIT transgene.\\nCONCLUSION\\nWe demonstrated the feasibility of using non-cell-autonomous effectors within a GPM context for the first time in Lepidoptera, one of the most economically damaging orders of insects. These findings provide a framework for extending this system to other pest Lepidoptera and to other secreted effectors. © 2021 The Authors.

       "  'abstract': 'C/EBPβ is a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family, which consists of a number of b-ZIP transcription factors. Although C/EBPβ has been implicated in the development of certain cancers, including breast cancer, it remains unknown whether dysregulation of C/EBPβ in breast cancer is subtype-specific. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms by which C/EBPβ regulates breast cancer carcinogenesis are not fully understood. Here, we present evidence that C/EBPβ is specifically overexpressed in human TNBC samples, but not in non-TNBC samples. C/EBPβ depletion dramatically suppressed TNBC cell growth, migration, invasion, and colony formation ability. A subsequent mechanistic study revealed that the JAK/STAT signaling pathway was upregulated in C/EBPβ_high TNBC samples compared with C/EBPβ_low TNBC samples. C/EBPβ ChIP-seq and qPCR were performed to demonstrate that C/EBPβ directly binds to and regulates JAK/STAT signaling pathway genes in TNBC. Taken together, our data indicate the oncogenic role of C/EBPβ in human TNBC and reveal a novel mechanism by which C/EBPβ promotes TNBC carcinogenesis.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE\\nIncreasing evidence suggests that human cholestasis is closely associated with the accumulation and activation of hepatic macrophages. Research indicates that activation of PPARγ exerts liver protective effects in cholestatic liver disease (CLD), particularly by ameliorating inflammation and fibrosis, thus limiting disease progression. However, existing PPARγ agonists, such as troglitazone and rosiglitazone, have significant side effects that prevent their clinical application in the treatment of CLD. In this study, we found that tectorigenin alleviates intrahepatic cholestasis in mice by activating PPARγ.\\nEXPERIMENTAL APPROACH\\nWild-type mice were intragastrically administered α-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) or fed a diet containing 0.1% 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) to simultaneously establish an experimental model of intrahepatic cholestasis and tectorigenin intervention, followed by determination of intrahepatic cholestasis and the mechanisms involved. In addition, PPARγ-deficient mice were administered ANIT and/or tectorigenin to determine whether tectorigenin exerts its liver protective effect by activating PPARγ.\\nKEY RESULTS\\nTreatment with tectorigenin alleviated intrahepatic cholestasis by inhibiting the recruitment and activation of hepatic macrophages and by promoting the expression of bile transporters via activation of PPARγ. Furthermore, tectorigenin increased expression of the bile salt export pump (BSEP) through enhanced PPARγ binding to the BSEP promoter. In PPARγ-deficient mice, the hepatoprotective effect of tectorigenin during cholestasis was blocked.\\nCONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS\\nIn conclusion, tectorigenin reduced the recruitment and activation of hepatic macrophages and enhanced the export of bile acids by activating PPARγ. Taken together, our results suggest that tectorigenin is a candidate compound for cholestasis treatment.',\n",

To increase the flight safety of networked UAVs, a recurrent wavelet fuzzy neural network (RWFNN) learning system with feedback loops is first designed to compensate for the unknown terms induced by the inherent nonlinearities, unexpected actuator, and sensor faults. Then, FO sliding-mode control (FOSMC), involving the adjustable FO operators and the robustness of SMC, are dexterously proposed to further enhance flight safety and reduce synchronization tracking errors. Moreover, the dynamic parameters of the RWFNN learning system embedded in the networked fixed-wing UAVs are updated based on adaptive laws. Furthermore, the Lyapunov analysis ensures that all fixed-wing UAVs can synchronously track their references with bounded tracking errors.

       "  'abstract': 'It has been widely recognized that the efficient training of neural networks (NNs) is crucial to classification performance. While a series of gradient-based approaches have been extensively developed, they are criticized for the ease of trapping into local optima and sensitivity to hyperparameters. Due to the high robustness and wide applicability, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been regarded as a promising alternative for training NNs in recent years. However, EAs suffer from the curse of dimensionality and are inefficient in training deep NNs (DNNs). By inheriting the advantages of both the gradient-based approaches and EAs, this article proposes a gradient-guided evolutionary approach to train DNNs. The proposed approach suggests a novel genetic operator to optimize the weights in the search space, where the search direction is determined by the gradient of weights. Moreover, the network sparsity is considered in the proposed approach, which highly reduces the network complexity and alleviates overfitting. Experimental results on single-layer NNs, deep-layer NNs, recurrent NNs, and convolutional NNs (CNNs) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In short, this work not only introduces a novel approach for training DNNs but also enhances the performance of EAs in solving large-scale optimization problems.',\n",

It occurs in a high percentage of newborns and in some older than 1 month. Pharmacological closure is the preferred initial treatment, as it has had excellent results; however, in those cases where it is not possible, surgical closure is indicated.\\nObjective\\nThe objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the surgical closure of the patent PDA when it is carried out by pediatric surgeons without specialization in cardiovascular surgery.\\nMethods\\nThis study was conducted at the West General Hospital, a 2nd level public hospital, with the diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus that required surgical correction. For the collection of the information, the files from January 2001 to December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed.\\nResults\\n224 patients were included; divided into two groups: Group I: 184 (82%) “newborns” and Group II: 40 (18%) “big children” with ages from 2 months to 8 years. All had a surgical closure; 3 by thoracoscopy and 221 by left posterolateral thoracotomy. 36 patients presented complications representing 16% of the total of patients, only 5.3% were major complications. 24 patients died in the postoperative period, representing a mortality of 10.7%, none died due to trans-surgical complications. PDA is a congenital heart defect that occurs in a high percentage of premature patients. The pharmacological closure is the principal treatment because it has had excellent results in newborns; however, in those cases where it is not possible, surgical closure it´s indicated. All patients were operated by general pediatric surgeons, with a global survival of 92%.\\nConclusions\\nWe conclude that in hospitals where there is no pediatric cardiovascular surgeon or interventional cardiologist, the surgical correction of the PDA can be carried out by a general pediatric surgeon.

       "  'abstract': 'SREBP1 and 2, are cholesterol sensors able to modulate cholesterol-related gene expression responses. SREBPs binding sites are characterized by the presence of multiple target sequences as SRE, NFY and SP1, that can be arranged differently in different genes, so that it is not easy to identify the binding site on the basis of direct DNA sequence analysis. This paper presents a complete workflow based on a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model able to detect putative SREBPs binding sites irrespective of target elements arrangements. The strategy is based on the recognition of SRE linked (less than 250 bp) to NFY sequences according to chromosomal localization derived from TF Immunoprecipitation (TF ChIP) experiments. The CNN is trained with several 100 bp sequences containing both SRE and NF-Y. Once trained, the model is used to predict the presence of SRE-NFY in the first 500 bp of all the known gene promoters. Finally, genes are grouped according to biological process and the processes enriched in genes containing SRE-NFY in their promoters are analyzed in details. This workflow allowed to identify biological processes enriched in SRE containing genes not directly linked to cholesterol metabolism and possible novel DNA patterns able to fill in for missing classical SRE sequences.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"BACKGROUND\\nCow milk is an important source of macro-and micronutrients. However, it has low iron content but high content of casein and calcium thus could negatively influence hemoglobin synthesis. On the other hand, camel milk contains higher iron concentration than cow milk. In addition, the majority of iron in camel milk is associated with the lower molecular fraction of casein suggesting better bioavailability. Furthermore, vitamin C concentration, a useful iron absorption enhancer, is more than three-fold greater in camel milk than cow milk. This study compared hemoglobin concentration among young children consuming consistently cow milk or camel milk.\\nMETHODS\\nHemoglobin concentration of young children (aged 6-59 mo) from settled pastoralist communities of the Somali region, Ethiopia, consistently consuming cow milk (n = 166) or camel milk (n = 166) was determined. In addition, socio-demographic and water, sanitation, and hygienic (WASH) conditions of study participants' households were captured. Furthermore, dietary intake and anthropometric characteristics of participating children were assessed.\\nRESULTS\\nAmong the participating children, 38.6% were underweight, 33.4% were stunted, and 34.5% were wasted. In addition, 77.4% of children were anemic. The present study households had poor WASH conditions. Only 0.6% of children had the minimum acceptable dietary diversity. There was small but significant mean hemoglobin difference among camel milk and cow milk consuming children (9.6±1.8 g/dl vs 9.1±2.2 g/dl; p = 0.012). In addition, the odds of low hemoglobin concentration was greater among cow milk consuming children than camel milk consuming children [AOR 2.17; 95 CI; 1.39, 3.37; p = 0.001]. However, the overall anemia prevalence among the two groups was similar.\\nCONCLUSION\\nCamel milk consumption is associated with better hemoglobin concentration but may not be sufficient to prevent anemia in populations from resource poor settings. The etiology of anemia is multifactorial thus further studies on the link between milk consumption and hemoglobin concentration are important.\",\n",

Reaction times down to <10\\u2005min without decrease in yield could be achieved through adding acetic acid as promoter, even for highly apolar biquinoxalines (yield >90\\u2009% in all cases). Moreover, it was shown that HTS has high compatibility: (i) hydrochlorides, a standard commercial form of amines, could be used directly as combined amine source and acidic catalyst, and (ii) Boc-diprotected o-PDA could be directly employed as substrate that underwent HT deprotection. A systematic large-scale computational comparison of all reported syntheses of the presented quinoxalines from the same starting compounds showed that this method is more environmentally friendly and less toxic than all existing methods and revealed generic synthetic routes for improving reaction yields.

       "  'abstract': 'OBJECTIVES\\nA database comprising multivariate data in developing a model from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis using human bio fluids are necessary to have reproducibility and reliability of the data. To achieve reproducibility of the data, standardised experiments, including internal standard and preservative used should be attained, especially for samples such as human bio fluids to hinder the variation among samples. The aim of the study was to optimise in commonly used human bio fluids (serum and urine) for a suitable internal standard and preservative used in extended storage samples for NMR analysis.\\nMETHODS\\nSerum and urine samples were collected from healthy human subjects. The experiment was divided into\\xa0two parts, part one to evaluate 2,2,2,2-tetradeutero-4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentanoic acid (TSP) and 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-ammonium trifluoroacetate (DSA) as the optimal internal standard for the serum and urine samples. The second part investigated the effects of preservatives in the serum and urine samples on extended storage.\\nRESULTS\\nOverall, TSP and DSA are suitable to be used as an internal standard in human urine samples. However, DSA is a superior internal standard in serum samples for NMR analysis. For the effect of preservative, the results indicated that human serum and urine samples could be stored without addition of preservative in\\xa0-80\\xa0°C, as no changes in NMR fingerprinting have been observed during storage in the absence or presence of the preservative.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThe findings suggest the use of DSA and TSP as an internal standard in serum and urine samples, respectively. Storage of serum and urine samples without any addition of preservative for an extended period has no effect on the metabolites changes. By having a standardised method, it will offer a considerable saving in both operator and spectrometer time and most importantly produce reproducible and reliable data.',\n",

In this study, BPTF associated protein of 18\\xa0kDa (BAP18) is decreased in luteinized granulosa cells (GCs) from PCOS women. BAP18 depletion significantly decreases CYP19A1 expression levels, leading to an abrogation in transfer capacity of androgen to estrogen in GCs. Also, BAP18 knockdown delays cell cycle G1 to S phase transition and induces cell apoptosis to decrease GCs proliferation. We also provide evidence showing BAP18 interacts with androgen receptor (AR) and enhances AR-mediated transactivation in GCs. Results indicate that AR or BAP18 recruits to androgen response elements (AREs) of CYP19A1 and FSHR, which are putative AR-induced genes in GCs. BAP18 interacts with Sp1 transcription factor and co-recruits to the promoter region of AR gene, resulting in AR transactivation in GCs.

Implementation of new biomarker-based methods may improve screening accuracy. Here, the levels of 25 microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) and 12 mRNAs involved in cervical carcinogenesis in 327 air-dried Papanicolaou-stained cervical smears from patients with cervical precancerous lesions, cancer, or without the disease were estimated by real-time PCR. Using logistic regression analysis, small-scale miRNA-based, mRNA-based, and combined molecular classifiers were built based on paired ratios of miRNA or mRNA concentrations; their ability to detect high-grade cervical lesions and cancer was then compared. Combined mRNA-miRNA classifiers manifested a better combination of sensitivity and specificity than miRNA- and mRNA-based classifiers. The best classifier, combining miR-375, miR-20, miR-96, CDKN2A, TSP4, and ECM1, predicted high-grade lesions with diagnostic sensitivity of 89.0%, specificity of 84.2%, and a receiver-operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.913. Additionally, in a subsample of the same specimens, the levels of MIR124-2 and MAL promoter methylation, HR-HPV genotypes, and viral loads were analyzed. The relative high-grade lesion risk estimated by the classifier correlated with the frequency of MAL and MIR124-2 methylation but not with the HR-HPV genotype or viral load.

Herein, we aimed to develop and validate a robust EMT-related prognostic signature that could predict the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\\nMETHODS\\nMessenger RNA expression matrix and clinicopathological data were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HCC tissues and adjacent non-tumor samples. Univariate Cox regression analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed to establish a prognosis signature. Kaplan-Meier survival curve, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC), multivariate Cox regression analysis, nomogram, C-index, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were performed to investigate the prognostic performance of the signature. The prognostic performance of the new signature was further validated in an independent external cohort.

       "  'abstract': 'Triphenyl phosphate (TPP) is a frequently used aryl organophosphate flame retardant. Epidemiological studies have shown that TPP and its metabolite diphenyl phosphate (DPP) can accumulate in the placenta, and positively correlated with abnormal birth outcomes. TPP can disturb placental hormone secretion through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) pathway. However, the extent and mechanism of placental toxicity mediation by TPP remains unknown. In this study, we used JEG-3\\xa0cells to investigate the role of PPARγ-regulated lipid metabolism in TPP-mediated placental toxicity. The results of lipidomic analysis showed that TPP increased the production of triglycerides (TG), fatty acids (FAs), and phosphatidic acid (PA), but decreased the levels of phosphatidylethanol (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), and sphingomyelin (SM). TG accumulation was accompanied by increased levels of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP1), acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACC), and fatty acid transport protein (CD36). Although PPARγ and its target CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPα) was decreased, the TG content and gene expression of SREBP1, ACC, and CD36 decreased when TPP was co-exposed to the PPARγ antagonist GW9662. TPP also induced inflammatory responses, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), and cell apoptosis. Expression of genes related to ERS and apoptosis were attenuated by GW9662. Together, these results show that TPP can disturb lipid metabolism and cause lipid accumulation through PPARγ, induce ERS, and cell apoptosis. Our findings reveal that the developmental toxicity of TPP through placental toxicity should not be ignored.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Temperatures as high as 100\\xa0°C have been reported at a few municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills in the U.S. A recently published model describing landfill heat accumulation identified reactions that contribute significant heat to landfills including the hydration and carbonation of Ca-containing wastes such as ash from MSW and coal combustion. The objective of this study was to develop a method to measure heat release from Ca-containing ash by isothermal calorimetry. The method was confirmed by comparing measured heat release from hydration and carbonation of pure CaO and Ca(OH)2 to the theoretical heat. Theoretical heat release was determined by characterizing test materials before and after experiments using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Heat recovery efficiencies with both water and synthetic leachate ranged from 79 to 90% for CaO hydration and between 65 and 74% for Ca(OH)2 carbonation, with no effect attributable to leachate. Additionally, simultaneous hydration and carbonation of CaO/Ca(OH)2 mixtures resulted in efficiencies of 65 to 74%. The developed method was applied to eight samples that were excavated from a landfill and known to contain coal ash, and the ratio of measured to theoretical heat was 0.5 to 4. Thus, calculation of theoretical heat release from XRD data was not a good predictor of the experimentally measured heat release. The developed method can be used by landfill operators to evaluate the heat potential of a waste, thereby facilitating decisions on the quantity of a waste that can be buried in consideration of landfill temperatures.',\n",

Early identification of patients with a high risk of DVT after trauma is crucial for thromboembolism prophylaxis. We aimed to develop and prospectively validate a novel risk score based on a nomogram to predict lower extremity DVT among multiple trauma patients.\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\nClinical data were collected from 281 multiple trauma patients who were admitted to our trauma center within 24\\xa0h of admission from January 2016 to September 2019 to develop a novel DVT risk score. The DVT risk estimates were then calculated prospectively based on the score in a new study cohort from October 2019 to July 2020. The technique of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to select variables for the early prediction of DVT in multiple trauma patients. The DVT risk assessment score (DRAS) was constructed by incorporating related features based on the LASSO analysis and nomogram prediction model. Further, the multiple trauma patients were divided into various risk groups according to the DRAS. The incidence of lower extremity DVT was compared between groups and the discrimination of the DRAS was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC).\\nRESULTS\\nBased on the LASSO method, seven variables (age, injury severity score, body mass index, lower extremity fracture, D-dimer level, fibrin degradation products, and prothrombin time) were included in the DRAS. A total of 166 multiple trauma patients were enrolled in the prospective study. Increased risk of DVT after trauma was related to higher DRAS. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the DRAS was 0.890 (0.841-0.940) in the validation cohort. Moreover, the discriminatory capacity of the DRAS was superior to that of each variable independently and the TESS score (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05).\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nWe developed and prospectively validated the DRAS as a reliable tool for predicting the risk of lower extremity DVT among patients with multiple trauma. This may help guide trauma surgeons in making sound decisions in the administration of DVT prophylaxis.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Zinc and cellular oxidants such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) each participate in a multitude of physiological functions. There is considerable overlap between the affected events, including signal transduction. While there is no obvious direct connection between zinc and ROS, mainly because the bivalent cation zinc does not change its oxidation state in biological systems, these are linked by their interaction with sulfur, forming the remarkable triad of zinc, ROS, and protein thiols. First, zinc binds to reduced thiols and can be released upon oxidation. Thereby, redox signals are translated into changes in the free zinc concentration, which can act as zinc signals. Second, zinc affects oxidation of thiols in several ways, directly as well as indirectly. A protein incorporating many of these interactions is metallothionein (MT), which is rich in cysteine and capable of binding up to seven zinc ions in its fully reduced state. Zinc binding is diminished after (partial) oxidation, while thiols show increased reactivity in the absence of bound metal ions. Adding still more complexity, the MT promoter is controlled by zinc (via metal regulatory transcription factor 1 (MTF-1)) as well as redox (via nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)). Many signaling cascades that are important for cell proliferation or apoptosis contain protein thiols, acting as centers for crosstalk between zinc- and redox-signaling. A prominent example for shared molecular targets for zinc and ROS are active site cysteine thiols in protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), their activity being downregulated by oxidation as well as zinc binding. Because zinc binding also protects PTP thiols form irreversible oxidation, there is a multi-faceted reciprocal interaction, illustrating that zinc- and redox-signaling are intricately linked on multiple levels.',\n",

Methods: From December 2018 to March 2019, 10 inpatients with mild and 10 inpatients with severe influenza pneumonia admitted to the Department of Infection and Clinical Microbiology of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital were included. Clariom™ D gene chip was used to explore the circRNA expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from the patients. The absolute value of the fold change (FC value)>2 and P<0.05 were used as the criteria to screen the differentially expressed circRNA, and the gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome database (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, KEGG) signal pathway enrichment analysis were also performed. Results: The age of mild patients [M (P25, P75)] was 62.0 (34.5, 69.8) years old, including 4 males; the age of severe patients [M (P25, P75)] was 50.0 (37.0, 60.0) years old, all were males. A total of 137 differentially expressed circRNAs in PBMCs of mild and severe patients were screened. The numbers of up-regulated and down-regulated circRNAs in mild patients were 101 and 36, respectively. Among them, hsa_circ_0091073 (FC value=160.898, P<0.05) was the most significantly up-regulated circRNA and hsa_circ_0092219 (FC value =-17.630, P<0.05) was the most significantly down-regulated circRNA. GO enrichment analysis showed that a total of 111 secondary GO items were significantly associated with related differential expression of circRNA (P<0.05). The GO terms associated with upregulated circRNAs included DNA-templated transcription, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase Ⅱ promoter, etc.; The GO terms associated with downregulated circRNAs included neutrophil degranulation, killing of cells of other organism, defense response to fungus, etc. KEGG signaling pathway analysis showed that there were 37 metabolic pathways related to differentially expressed circRNAs (P<0.05). Signaling pathways related to up-regulated circRNAs included nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, etc. Signaling pathways related to down-regulation of circRNAs included cancer transcription disorders, folate carbon pool, and other types of O-glycan biosynthesis. Conclusion: The expression of circRNA in PBMC of mild and severe influenza pneumonia patients is significantly different, and it may play a role in the pathogenic mechanism of influenza pneumonia through multiple signal pathways.',\n",

Load-independent RV contractility, as assessed by RV maximal change in pressure over time normalized to instantaneous pressure, was higher in biventricular pacing compared with unpaced conduction (15.7±7.6 versus 11.0±4.0\\xa0s-1; P=0.003). Thermodilution cardiac output was higher in biventricular pacing compared with unpaced conduction (4.48±0.7 versus 4.38±0.8 L/min; P=0.05). There were no significant differences in heart rate, ventricular filling pressures, or atrioventricular valvular regurgitation across all pacing configurations. Conclusions Biventricular pacing acutely improves load-independent RV contractility in patients with LVADs. Even in these patients with mechanical left ventricular unloading via LVAD who were relative pacing nonresponders (required LVAD support despite cardiac resynchronization therapy), biventricular pacing was acutely beneficial to RV contractility.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Bacillus spp. are the main sources of subtilisin E, which has several applications in biotechnology. The 3D structure of subtilisin E has a significant impact on its efficacy. In this study, we evaluated subtilisin E from Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168 by bioinformatic methods. The results revealed that the subtilisin E sequence from B. subtilis contains highly conserved amino acids, including histidine (H), aspartic acid (D) and serine (S). Subtilisin E cleaves the bonds between hydrophobic and polar amino acids in keratin-associated proteins. The effects of point mutations on the crystal structure of subtilisin E (PDB ID: 1SCJ) showed that changes of asparagine 123 (N123) to valine (V) and serine 331 (S331) to leucine (L) respectively, were the most stabilizing. Genomic analysis of the subtilisin E-coding gene (aprE) indicated that this gene and the yhfN gene are expressed through a σA promoter. The analysis of TBFs revealed AbrB, ScoC, DegU, Hpr, σA, SinR, TenA, and DegU as relevant regulators of aprE expression. Phylogenetic analysis showed that subtilisin Es have highly conserved structures among Bacillus spp., sharing a common ancestor, where their coding genes were duplicated and evolved within the Bacillus spp. As the conclusion, our in silico study demonstrated that the overexpression of the aprE gene and stability of the produced subtilisin E can be improved though system biology methods such as point mutations and identifying the involved transcription factors (TFs) or/and TBFs.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND\\nStaufen2 (STAU2) is an RNA binding protein involved in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. In neurons, STAU2 is required to maintain the balance between differentiation and proliferation of neural stem cells through asymmetric cell division. However, the importance of controlling STAU2 expression for cell cycle progression is not clear in non-neuronal dividing cells. We recently showed that STAU2 transcription is inhibited in response to DNA-damage due to E2F1 displacement from the STAU2 gene promoter. We now study the regulation of STAU2 steady-state levels in unstressed cells and its consequence for cell proliferation.\\nRESULTS\\nCRISPR/Cas9-mediated and RNAi-dependent STAU2 depletion in the non-transformed hTERT-RPE1 cells both facilitate cell proliferation suggesting that STAU2 expression influences pathway(s) linked to cell cycle controls. Such effects are not observed in the CRISPR STAU2-KO cancer HCT116 cells nor in the STAU2-RNAi-depleted HeLa cells. Interestingly, a physiological decrease in the steady-state level of STAU2 is controlled by caspases. This effect of peptidases is counterbalanced by the activity of the CHK1 pathway suggesting that STAU2 partial degradation/stabilization fines tune cell cycle progression in unstressed cells. A large-scale proteomic analysis using STAU2/biotinylase fusion protein identifies known STAU2 interactors involved in RNA translation, localization, splicing, or decay confirming the role of STAU2 in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. In addition, several proteins found in the nucleolus, including proteins of the ribosome biogenesis pathway and of the DNA damage response, are found in close proximity to STAU2. Strikingly, many of these proteins are linked to the kinase CHK1 pathway, reinforcing the link between STAU2 functions and the CHK1 pathway. Indeed, inhibition of the CHK1 pathway for 4 h dissociates STAU2 from proteins involved in translation and RNA metabolism.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThese results indicate that STAU2 is involved in pathway(s) that control(s) cell proliferation, likely via mechanisms of posttranscriptional regulation, ribonucleoprotein complex assembly, genome integrity and/or checkpoint controls. The mechanism by which STAU2 regulates cell growth likely involves caspases and the kinase CHK1 pathway.',\n",

Collagen-I expression using ELISA was performed. The luciferase activity was used to examine the activity of C/EBPβ. Knockdown of C/EBPβ was performed by siRNA. We also investigated the effect of deacetylation of C/EBPβ on EMT using sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). The binding ability of C/EBPβ with α-SMA promoter was affirmed via chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA). The relationship between α-SMA and acetylated C/EBPβ was determined with co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). SiRNA-mediated knockdown of C/EBPβ in A549 cells attenuated TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast differentiation and ECM deposition. The extent of association between acetylated C/EBPβ and α-SMA promoter was dynamically monitored.\\nRESULTS\\nIt was confirmed that deacetylation of C/EBPβ in A549 cells successfully ameliorated TGF-β1-induced EMT, as shown by reduction in α-SMA expression and excessive collagen-I accumulation.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe EMT and fibrotic effect of TGF-β1 is dependent on acetylated C/EBPβ-mediated regulation of α-SMA gene activity. Thus, C/EBPβ acetylation may play a central role in pulmonary fibrosis.',\n",

This time-based deferment has reduced since 2013; from an initial lifetime ban, to five-years, one-year, and now three-months. Our previous research revealed that gay, bisexual, queer, and other MSM (GBM) supported making blood donation policies gender-neutral and behaviour-based. In this analysis, we explored the willingness of Canadian GBM to donate plasma, even if they were not eligible to donate blood.\\nMETHODS\\nWe conducted in-depth interviews with 39 HIV-negative GBM in Vancouver (n\\u2009=\\u200915), Toronto (n\\u2009=\\u200913), and Montreal (n\\u2009=\\u200911), recruited from a large respondent-driven sampling study called Engage. Men received some basic information on plasma donation prior to answering questions. Transcripts were coded in NVivo following inductive thematic analysis.\\nRESULTS\\nMany GBM expressed a general willingness to donate plasma if they became eligible; like with whole blood donation, GBM conveyed a strong desire to help others in need. However, this willingness was complicated by the fact that most participants had limited knowledge of plasma donation and were unsure of its medical importance. Participants\\' perspectives on a policy that enabled MSM to donate plasma varied, with some viewing this change as a \"stepping stone\" to a reformed blood donation policy and others regarding it as insufficient and constructing GBM as \"second-class\" donors. When discussing plasma, many men reflected on the legacy of blood donor policy-related discrimination. Our data reveal a significant plasma policy disjuncture-a gulf between the critical importance of plasma donation from the perspective of Canada\\'s blood operators and patients and the feelings of many GBM who understood this form of donation as less important.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nPlasma donor policies must be considered in relation to MSM blood donation policies to understand how donor eligibility practices are made meaningful by GBM in the context of historical disenfranchisement. Successful establishment of a MSM plasma donor policy will require extensive education, explicit communication of how this new policy contributes to continued/stepwise reform of blood donor policies, and considerable reconciliation with diverse GBM communities.',\n",

The aim of this study was to determine whether the absolute number of methylated Cytosine-Guanine-dinucleotide-(CpG-)sites within the DMR-2 island of the MGMT-promoter may correlate with outcome in a qualitative or quantitative fashion. In a cohort of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients treated with stereotactic biopsy or open tumor resection plus concomitant chemoradiotherapy, we assessed MGMT-promoter methylation by methylation-specific polymerase-chain-reaction (MSP). Methylation of the CpG-sites 74-98 within the MGMT-promoter region was additionally analysed by Sanger sequencing, and the total number of methylated CpG-sites was correlated with outcome using proportional hazards models. 215 patients with glioblastoma were identified and stratified per MSP (positive: 53%, negative: 47%). Among MSP-positive tumors, hierarchical clustering identified three subgroups with different methylation rates (median: 80% vs. 52% vs. 47%), indicating a site-dependent methylation propagation. The methylation status of a given CpG-site indicated a neighborhood-dependent methylation propagation. Survival was linearly associated with the cumulative number of methylated CpG-sites. This was particularly true in patients who received at least one adjuvant cycle of temozolomide. Notably, all CpG-sites analyzed contributed similarly to effect size; this enabled a further predictive substratification of MSP-positive tumors with median OS ranging from as low as 17.1\\xa0months (<\\u200918 methylated CpG-sites) to as high as 26.2\\xa0months (≥\\u200918 methylated CpG-sites) in the overall cohort.

As a main source of n-3 LC-PUFA for human consumers, the n-3 LC-PUFA content of farmed fish is important. Previously, we identified fatty acid-binding protein (fabp)-4 as a candidate gene for regulating the n-3 LC-PUFA content. Herein, we further assessed the role of fabp4 in this process. First, a 2059 bp promoter sequence of fabp4 in Trachinotus ovatus was cloned and, using progressive deletion, determined -2006 bp to -1521 bp to be the core promoter sequence. The PPAR-γ binding sites were predicted to occur in this region. A luciferase reporter assay showed that the promoter activity of fabp4 decreased following mutation of the PPARγ binding site and that PPARγ increased the fabp4 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner, implying that T. ovatus fabp4 is a target of PPARγ. The overexpression of fabp4 or PPARγ increased the DHA content in hepatocytes, whereas suppression of their expression diminished this effect, suggesting that both fabp4 and PPARγ play an active role in regulating DHA content. Moreover, the inhibition of fabp4 attenuated the increase in PPARγ-mediated DHA content, and the overexpression of fabp4 alleviated this effect. Collectively, our findings indicated that fabp4, which is controlled by PPARγ, plays an important role in DHA content regulation. The new regulation axis can be considered a promising novel target for increasing the n-3 LC-PUFA content in T. ovatus.',\n",

Single cell analysis of accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) can overcome this limitation.<br>"

Likewise, TE accumulation is tightly linked to heterochromatinization and centromeric dynamics, which can ultimately contribute to speciation. Despite growing efforts to characterize the repeat landscape of species, few studies have focused on mapping the accumulation profiles of TEs on chromosomes.<br>"
