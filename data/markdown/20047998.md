Upstream ORFs (uORFs) are translational control elements found predominantly in transcripts of key regulatory genes. No mammalian genetic model exists to experimentally validate the physiological relevance of uORF-regulated translation initiation. We report that mice deficient for the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein b $\mathbf{\left(C/EBP\upbeta\right)}$ uORF initiation codon fail to initiate translation of the autoantagonistic LIP (liver inhibitory protein) $\mathbf{C}/\mathbf{EBP\upbeta}$ isoform. C/EBPbDuORF mice show hyperactivation of acute-phase response genes, persistent repression of E2F-regulated genes, delayed and blunted S-phase entry of hepatocytes after partial hepatectomy, and impaired osteoclast differentiation. These data and the widespread prevalence of uORFs in mammalian transcriptomes suggest a comprehensive role of uORF-regulated translation in (patho)physiology.

Translational cis-regulatory upstream ORFs (uORFs) are found in the $5^{\prime}$ mRNA regions of numerous eukaryotic transcripts and are considered to regulate protein expression by controlling translation reinitiation at downstream initiation codons or by activating the nonsensemediated mRNA decay pathway (Morris and Geballe 2000). The frequency of conserved uORFs (Iacono et al. 2005; Calvo et al. 2009) and their predominant prevalence in transcripts of key regulatory genes of growth, differentiation, and proliferation (Kozak 1987) suggest an important function of uORF-mediated translational control in mammals. Nevertheless, an experimental genetic model to examine the physiological relevance of uORF-regulated translation has not been established.  

The transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein $\upbeta$ $,~\vert\mathrm{C/EBP\beta}\vert$ exerts important functions in many physiological processes, including metabolism, innate immunity, liver development, and regeneration (Tanaka et al. 1995; Greenbaum et al. 1998; Ramji and Foka 2002). The $C/E B P\beta$ gene lacks introns, yet three N-terminal different isoforms (termed LAP\* [liver-activating protein\*], LAP, and LIP [liver inhibitory protein]) are translated from three consecutive in-frame AUG codons in a single transcript (Fig. 1A; Descombes and Schibler 1991). The truncated isoform LIP is devoid of N-terminal trans-activating domains but retains DNA-binding capacity and acts as a competitive inhibitor of the LAP and $L{\sf A P}^{\star}$ isoforms. Previous mutational analysis and tissue culture experiments suggested that translation of the conserved out-offrame $C/E B\mathrm{P}\beta$ uORF restrains initiation of LAP and causes resumption of ribosomal scanning and reinitiation at the downstream LIP start site (Fig. 1B; Raught et al. 1996; Lincoln et al. 1998; Calkhoven et al. 2000).  

# Results and Discussion  

To determine the physiological importance of uORFmediated translational control, recombinant mice were generated by introduction of an ATG-to-TTG point mutation at the $C/\mathrm{EBP\beta}$ uORF translational initiation site (Fig. 1B; Supplemental Fig. S2). The C/EBPbDuORF mutation was designed to abrogate uORF initiation without altering the amino acid sequence of $C/\mathrm{EBP\beta}$ . A $\scriptstyle\sum/\mathrm{EBP\upbeta}$ wild-type knock-in control strain $|{\mathsf{C}}/{\mathrm{E}}{\dot{\mathrm{B}}}{\mathsf{P}}\upbeta^{\mathrm{WT}}\rangle$ was generated and analyzed in parallel to exclude potential artifacts caused by the gene targeting approach. Throughout the experiments, no differences were detected between C/EBPbWT and parental wild-type mice. Offspring of heterozygous C/EBPbDuORF matings showed the expected Mendelian ratio (Supplemental Table S1). Homozygous C/EBPbDuORF mice showed normal weight gain andno overt developmental defects or premature death (Supplemental Fig. S3). In contrast to $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta}$ knockout animals, homozygous $\dot{\mathsf{C/E B P\upbeta^{\Delta u O R F}}}$ females were fertile, gave birth to normal size litters (eight out of eight females tested), and showed intact mammary gland development and function (Robinson et al. 1998; Seagroves et al. 1998; Supplemental Figs. ${\mathsf{S3A}},$ S4).  

Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major inducer of acute-phase response mediated by $C/\mathrm{EBP\beta}$ in the liver (Poli 1998), and has been shown to enhance expression of the truncated $C/\mathrm{EBP\beta}$ isoform LIP (Timchenko et al. 2005). In livers of $\mathrm{C/\dot{E}B P\beta^{W T}}$ mice, LIP was strongly induced after LPS administration, whereas $\mathrm{C/EBP\vec{\beta}^{\Delta u O R F}}$ mice failed to express high levels of LIP (Fig. 1C). Likewise,lung, spleen, andwhite adiposetissue of C/EBPbDuORF mice displayed reduced expression of LIP after LPS treatment as compared with C/EBPbWT tissues (Supplemental Fig. S5). Failure to induce LIP was also observed in $\mathrm{C/EBP\vec{\beta}^{\Delta u O R F}}$ mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) (Fig. 1D) and was associated with superactivation of a C/EBPresponsive luciferase reporter (Fig. 1E), suggesting a lack of trans-repressive function of LIP. Hence, genetic ablation of the $C/\mathrm{EBP\beta}$ uORF in mice abolishes the inducible expression of LIP and validates the functional importance of the $C/\mathrm{EBP\beta}$ uORF as a translational cis-regulatory element in the animal.

Wethmar et al.  

Recently, we showed that the long and truncated $\mathrm{C/EBP/3}$ isoforms opposingly regulate the differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts (Smink et al. 2009). C/EBPbLIP mice that express LIP only and not the long C/EBPb isoforms showed strongly enhanced osteoclast differentiation. Ectopic expression of LAP inhibited osteoclast differentiation (Smink et al. 2009), suggesting that an increase of the LAP/LIP isoform ratio in $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{\DeltauORF}}$ mice would also inhibit osteoclastogenesis. In tibiae of $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{\DeltauORF}}$ mice, we observed a reduction in osteoclast size and number (Fig. 2A), which was accompanied by an increase in thickness of bone trabeculae and bone volume (Supplemental Fig. S6). Bone marrow cell cultures from C/EBPbDuORF mice formed fewer and smaller osteoclasts as compared with C/EBPbWT and failed to express LIP (Fig. 2B,C). C/EBPbDuORF osteoclasts showed increased expression of the transcription factor MafB (Fig. 2D), a previously identified target of LAP and a repressor of osteoclastogenesis (Smink et al. 2009). MafB inhibits a number of osteoclastic genes, including Nfatc1, Oscar, Atp6v0d2, DC-STAMP, and TRACP (Kim et al. 2007, 2008; Smink et al. 2009). Transcript levels of these osteoclast markers were found to be reduced in C/EBPbDuORF osteoclasts (Fig. 2E), while expression of the MafB-independent $c$ -Fos gene (Kim et al. 2007) was not affected. These data suggest that the abrogation of C/EBPb uORF-mediated translational control, and the resulting increase in the LAP/LIP ratio, constrains osteoclast differentiation by enhancing the expression of MafB.

Figure 1. Genetic ablation of cis-regulatory translational control by the $C/\mathrm{EBP\upbeta}$ uORF. (A) Three protein isoforms (LAP\* $[38\ \mathrm{kDa}],$ LAP $[35\;\mathrm{kDa}],$ , and LIP $[20\,\mathrm{kDa}]|$ are translated from consecutive in-frame initiation codons in the same transcript (Descombes and Schibler 1991). The $C/\mathrm{EBP\upbeta}$ mRNA contains a conserved cis-regulatory small uORF (30 base pairs [bp], orange) terminating 4 bp upstream of the LAP initiation site in a different reading frame. (bd) Binding; (pA) poly(A) tail. $\left\vert B\right\vert$ Translation of the uORF serves to strip ribosomes from their initiating $\mathsf{M e t-t R N A_{i}^{\,\mathrm{Met}}}$ (green to white) and prevents initiation at the proximate LAP initiation codon. Upon reloading of ribosomes with the ternary eIF2–GTP–Met-tRNAiMet complex (white to green), translation reinitiation from the downstream AUG codon generates LIP. In $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{\DeltauORF}}$ mice, an A-to-U point mutation was designed to abrogate ribosomal initiation at the uORF start codon without changing the amino acid sequence of the $C/\mathrm{EBP\upbeta}$ isoforms. Most ribosomes will thus initiate at the LAPAUG instead. (Display of $L\mathbf{A}\mathbf{P}^{\star}$ translation was omitted for simplicity. For details on alternative start site selection, see Supplemental Fig. S1.) $\vert C\vert$ Upon i.p. injection of LPS, LIP is strongly induced in $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{WT}}$ (WT) but not in $\mathrm{C/EBP\upbeta^{\DeltauORF}}$ livers $\left\langle\Delta\right\rangle$ .

Since $C/\mathrm{EBP\beta}$ is an important regulator of liver regeneration, acute-phase response, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression (Screpanti et al. 1995; Greenbaum et al. 1998; Poli 1998), we implemented partial hepatectomy (PH) to analyze the consequences of the C/EBPbDuORF mutation in this physiological context. $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{\DeltaiORF}}$ mice failed to induce expression of the truncated LIP isoform throughout the 72-h observation period after PH (Fig. 3A), while LIP was strongly induced in a two-wave kinetic in regenerating livers of $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{WT}}$ animals, suggesting consecutive functions of LIP in the course of liver regeneration. After PH, IL-6 serum levels of $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{\DeltauORF}}$ mice rose higher as compared with control animals (Fig. 3B), reaching a 4.7-fold difference after $^{3\mathrm{~h~}}$ ($1254\,\pm\,265$ vs. $263\,\pm\,49$ $\mathrm{{pg/mL},}$ $n=6,$ $P<0.01$ ) and a 3.3-fold difference at the peak of wild-type expression $6\,\mathrm{{h}}$ after surgery $(1578\pm132$ vs. $472\;\pm\;93~\,\mathrm{{pg/mL},}$ $n\;=\;6,$ $P\,<\,0.01$ ). IL-6 signaling is known to rapidly confer activating phosphomodifications to both $\bar{\mathsf{C}}/\mathsf{E B P\beta}$ and STAT3 transcription factors (Akira 1997), resulting in synergistic induction of type I acute-phase response genes (Alonzi et al. 2001). Real-time PCR analysis of known acute-phase response $C/\mathrm{EBP\beta}$ target genes revealed consistently increased transcription of serum amyloid A1 (Saa1), a-1 antitrypsin $(A a{\bar{t}}),$ haptoglobin $\begin{array}{r}{\left|H p\right|,}\end{array}$ and hemopexin $\boldsymbol{\left|H p x\right|},$ ranging from 1.2-fold to 8.0-fold in hepatectomized $\dot{\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{\DeltauORF}}}$ as compared with $\mathrm{C/EBP/3}^{\mathrm{WT}}$ mice (Fig. 3C). Maxima of enhanced expression of Saa1, Aat, and Hp in C/EBPbDuORF mice correlated with the peak of LAP expression at $6~\mathrm{{h}}$ after surgery (Fig. 3A). Together with the superactivation of the C/EBP-responsive reporter construct in $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{\DeltauORF}}$ MEFs, these data suggest that uORF-mediated induction of LIP serves to restrict the trans-activation of early acutephase response genes.

In an in vitro proliferation assay, reduced expansion of $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{\DeltauORF}}$ MEF cultures became evident at day 3 (Fig. 4A) and resulted in significantly lower cell numbers at

day 5 of the experiment $(9.2\pm0.2\$ vs. $11.9\pm0.5\times10^{5}$ per well, $n=5.$ ,$P<0.01\vert$ as compared with $\mathrm{\underline{{C}}/E B P\beta^{W T}}$ MEFs. To examine whether the $\dot{\mathsf{C}}/\mathrm{EBP\beta^{\DeltauORF}}$ mutation also affected cell proliferation in mice, we compared liver regeneration properties of $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{\DeltauORF}},$ $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{WT}},$ and $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{LIP}}$ animals $\vert\mathrm{C/EBP\upbeta}$ expression control in Supplemental Fig. S7). Hepatocytes in regenerating livers of $\dot{\mathsf{C}}/\mathrm{EBP}\upbeta^{\Delta\mathrm{uORF}}$ mice entered the cell cycle later and at lower frequency as compared with $\mathrm{C/E\!BP/3}^{\mathrm{WT}}$ animals (Fig. 4B,C). S-phase labeling of liver cells by 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) revealed a 9.3-fold reduction in the proportion of BrdU-positive $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{\DeltauORF}}$ hepatocytes at $\bar{36}\,\mathrm{h}$ $(1.2\%\,\pm\,0.5\%$ vs. $11.6\%\,\pm\,2.8\%$ ,$n=8$ ,$P<0.01$ )and a 1.9-fold reduction at $48~\mathrm{h}$ after surgery $(28.9\%\ \pm$ $4.0\%$ vs. $54.9\%\:\pm\:3.8\%_{\pm}$ ,$n\,=\,7\,.$ ,$P<0.01$ ). At the same times, regenerating $\mathrm{C/EBP\upbeta^{LIP}}$ livers contained similar numbers of BrdU-positive hepatocytes as compared with $\mathrm{C/EBP/3}^{\mathrm{WT}}$ $(36\textrm{h:}\bar{1}1.5\%\textrm{\,\pm\,}\bar{0.}4\%_{)}$ ,$n=5$ ; 48 h: $56.9\%$ 6 $2.1\%$ ,$\smash{\ensuremath{n_{\mathrm{~\rightmoon~}}}=\mathrm{~\ensuremath~{4~}~}}$ . Virtually no BrdU incorporation was observed in hepatocytes of sham-operated animals at 48 $_\mathrm{h}$ after PH $\bar{\left(n\right.\right.}=\left.3\right)$ (data not shown). Transcript levels of cyclin A1 (CcnA1), CcnA2, CcnB1, CcnE1, CcnE2, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Pcna) were induced at $\bar{3}6~\mathrm{h}$ after PH in $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{WT}}$ and $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{LIP}}$ livers, but remained significantly lower in $\mathrm{C/EBP\dot{\beta}^{\Delta u O R F}}$ animals (Fig. 4D). Twelve hours later, the expression of the cyclins and Pcna were similar in the three genotypes (data not shown), suggesting that re-entry of $\mathrm{C/E\"{BP\beta}^{\Delta u O R F}}$ hepatocytes into the cell cycle was impaired but not abolished by the compromised induction of LIP. Similar recovery of liver weight in C/EBPbWT and C/EBPbDuORF mice, accompanied by an increased hepatocyte volume in $\dot{\mathrm{C/EBP\upbeta^{\Delta\mathrm{iORF}}}}$ bDuORF livers (Supplemental Fig. S8), suggested that enhanced hepatocyte hypertrophy compensated for the blunted S-phase entry to restore adequate liver/body weight ratios.  

To further characterize the altered dynamics of cell cycle entry in regenerating $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{\DeltauORF}}$ livers, we performed a genome-wide microarray expression analysis at $\,\!36\,\!\mathrm{h}$ after PH. A total number of 546 underrepresented transcripts (392 annotated genes) and 266 overrepresented transcripts (161 annotated genes) were identified in regenerating C/EBPbDuORF as compared with $\mathrm{C/EBP/3}^{\mathrm{WT}}$ livers (Fig. 5A; Supplemental Table S2). Comparison of all deregulated transcripts to a database of cell cycle-associated genes (http://www.geneontology.org) resulted in 191 matches, of which $99\%$ (189 matches) grouped to the underrepresented fraction (Fig. $5\mathrm{A}_{i}$ ; Supplemental Table S3). The microarray analysis results were validated for a selection of transcripts on the mRNA (Fig. 4D) and/or the protein level (Supplemental Fig. S9). The high proportion of underrepresented cell cycle genes at $36~\mathrm{~h~}$ after PH verified the immunohistochemically detected reduction in hepatocyte S-phase entry in $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{\DeltauORF}}$ mice on a transcriptional level, and implied a regulatory function of the $\mathrm{C/\bar{E}B P\beta}$ LAP/LIP isoform ratio.  

C/EBP transcription factors are known to affect the expression of cell cycle regulatory genes controlled by E2F transcription factors (Sebastian and Johnson 2006; Nerlov 2007). Full-length $C/\mathrm{EBP\alpha}$ (p42), but not the N-terminally truncated isoform (p30), acts as a cell cycle inhibitor by repressing E2F target genes (Slomiany et al. 2000; Porse et al. 2001; Iakova et al. 2003). For $\mathrm{{C/EBP/3}},$ isoform-specific data on E2F coregulation is scarce and suggested a corepressive function of LAP (Sebastian et al. 2005). A comparison of deregulated cell cycle genes in regenerating $\dot{\mathsf{C}}/\mathrm{EBP\upbeta^{\DeltauORF}}$ liver to previously identified E2F targets (Ishida et al. 2001; Ren et al. 2002; Bracken et al. 2004) revealed that at least $42\%$ of them were known E2F target genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis performed $\ensuremath{36}\,\ensuremath{\mathrm{h}}$ after PH showed that both E2F3 and $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta}$ were associated with promoters of underrepresented E2F target genes in regenerating liver (E2F1, Rbl1 [retinoblastoma-like 1], CcnA2, CcnE1, Cdc2 [cell division cycle-associated 2], Cdc25, Mcm3 [minichromosome maintenance-deficient 3], Mcm6, and Plk1 [Polo-like kinase 1]) (Fig. 5B). At the same time, $C/\mathrm{EBP\alpha}$ showed little or no association with these E2F target gene promoters. Furthermore, transient down-regulation of transcript and protein levels of $C/\mathrm{EBP\alpha}$ after PH (Supplemental Fig. S10) suggested a predominant role for $\mathrm{\dot{C}/E B P\beta}$ in the coregulation of many E2F target genes in cycling hepatocytes. To examine the effect of individual $\mathrm{C/EBP\bar{\beta}}$ isoforms on E2F coregulation, we used an E2F-responsive luciferase reporter construct that has been employed previously to address the mechanism of C/EBP-mediated E2F repression (Porse et al. 2001). Luciferase activity induced by ectopic expression of the transcription factors E2F1 and DP1 (dimerization partner 1, conferring full activity to E2F1) was proportionally repressed by increasing amounts of coexpressed p42, ${\mathrm{LAP}}^{\star}$ , or LAP, but remained unaffected by coexpression of p30 or LIP (Fig. 5C). Importantly, the inhibition of E2F activity by $\mathrm{p}42$ was effectively relieved by coexpression of LIP, whereas increasing amounts of $L\mathrm{AP}^{\star}$ or LAP further repressed reporter activity (Fig. 5D). Liver regeneration defects observed in $\mathrm{C/EBP/3}$ knockout mice have been attributed to a lack of coactivating $\mathrm{C/EBP/3}$ function on E2F target genes (Greenbaum et al. 1998; Wang et al. 2007). This interpretation contrasts data showing E2F-repressive functions of LAP in vitro (Sebastian et al. 2005) and LAP-mediated retardation of hepatocyte cell cycle entry after PH in mice (Luedde et al. 2004). Our observations of impaired cell cycle entry in $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{\DeltauORF}}$ livers and the rescue of this phenotype in $\dot{\mathrm{C/EBP\dot{\upbeta}^{L I P}}}$ mice suggest that long $C/\mathrm{EBP\beta}$ isoforms are dispensable for accurate hepatocyte S-phase entry. The data presented here imply a model in which uORFmediated induction of LIP is required to overcome repression of E2F targets by long $C/\mathrm{EBP\alpha}$ and $\mathrm{C/EBP/3}$ isoforms to facilitate rapid cell cycle entry during liver regeneration.

The analysis of the $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{\DeltauORF}}$ mice proves the physiological relevance of uORF-mediated translational control in mammals. We note that low amounts of LIP can be detected in C/EBPbDuORF mice, which might originate from leaky ribosomal scanning over both the $L{\mathrm{AP}}^{\star}$ and LAP start codons (Supplemental Fig. S1) or from partial proteolytic cleavage (Baer and Johnson 2000). Nevertheless, the lack of a functional $C/\mathrm{EBP\beta}$ uORF start codon results in the inability to induce LIP expression under inflammatory conditions, as well as during differentiation and regeneration processes. Aberrant protein expression caused by defective translational control is increasingly recognized as a pathophysiological mechanism in the etiology of human diseases (Scheper et al. 2007). Specifically, mutations affecting uORF-mediated translational control have been connected to the development of diseases such as hereditary thrombocythemia (Wiestner et al. 1998), familial cutaneous melanoma (Liu et al. 1999), or Marie Unna hereditary hypotrichosis (Wen et al. 2009). The high prevalence of uORFs in human transcripts $(35\,\%{-}49\,\%)$ implies a comprehensive, yet underestimated, cis-regulatory function in adjusting protein expression (Iacono et al. 2005; Calvo et al. 2009). Future studies will have to address to what extent aberrant uORF-mediated translational control accounts for the development of disease, and how it can be targeted by therapeutic intervention.

# Generation of $C/E B P\beta^{\varDelta u O R F}$ and C/EBPbWT mice  

Mutant $(\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{\DeltauORF}})$ and control $(\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{WT}})$ mice were generated by homologous recombination according to standard protocols (Supplemental Fig. S2). The neomycin cassette was removed by crossing $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{\DeltauORF}}$ and $\mathrm{C/EBP\beta^{WT}}$ mice to the Cre-deleter strain (Schwenk et al. 1995), and the new strains were kept in a $129\mathrm{Ola}\times\mathrm{C57Bl}/6$ background. Female and male mice showed the same phenotype and were analyzed as one group. Mice were provided with standard mouse diet and water ad libitum on a 12-h light–dark cycle. All procedures and animal experiments were conducted in compliance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.  

Additional methods can be found in the Supplemental Material.
